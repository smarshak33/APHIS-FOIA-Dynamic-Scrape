Dear Sir or Madam:

We believe that you failed to comply with the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. §
2131 et seq.) (AWA), and its implementing regulations, as described in the
attached Official Warning. Our agency, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS), is responsible for enforcing the AWA, and regulations and
other agriculture laws that help prevent the spread of animal and plant pests and
diseases, and ensure the welfare of animals.

After providing you with an opportunity for a hearing, we may pursue civil
penalties of up to $10,000, or other sanctions, for each alleged violation described
in this Official Warning. Although we have authority to pursue penalties for this
type of alleged violation(s), we have decided not to pursue penalties in this

instance so long as you comply, in the future, with the AWA and regulations.

What happens if I do not comply in the future? If you fail to comply in the
future, we may pursue criminal penalties, or we may pursue civil penalties for the
alleged violations described in this Official Warning, in addition to any penalties
we may pursue for any future violations.

What should I do if I have questions? If you have any questions concerning this
Official Warning, contact Olivia Simmons at (301) 851-2757 or call our main
office at (301) 851-2948.

Iam a small business owner and have comments or concerns regarding
APHIS’s enforcement of animal and plant health laws. Who should I contact?
If you have comments about APHIS’s enforcement of animal and plant health
laws, please contact me, Steven M. Bennett, the APHIS Small Business
Ombudsperson, at (301) 851-2948. If you prefer to comment to someone outside
APHIS, contact the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsperson at
http://sba.gov/ombudsman, email ombudsman@sba.gov, or 1-888-REG-
