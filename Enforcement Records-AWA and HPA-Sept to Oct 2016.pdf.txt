You failed to inform APHIS officials of all of the areas containing
regulated animals so that APHIS could inspect them. APHIS asked

areas only contained the garbage dump, birds, and/or reptiles, and did
not disclose that they contained regulated animals until APHIS asked
to see those areas.

Date of Violation: May 4, 2015

nonhuman primates must meet the following minimum requirements: General
requirements. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that
they enable all surfaces in contact with nonhuman primates to be readily
cleaned and sanitized, or replaced when worn or soiled.

You failed to construct and maintain enclosures so that surfaces
could be readily cleaned or replaced when worn or soiled. The
enclosure housing two tamarins in the Tropics building had an area
approximately 5 inches long of exposed wood near the exhibit
window which could not be adequately cleaned or sanitized.

You failed to remove excreta as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals and minimize disease hazards. The

feces on the ground, such that the animals could not lie in their
enclosure without becoming contaminated by the waste material.

The penalty for the alleged violation(s) described above is $2,350.

CITATION AND NOTIFICATION OF PENALTY

We believe that you violated the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. § 2131 et seq.)
(AWA), as described below.

Date of Violation: April 29, 2014

9 C.F.R. § 2.40(b)(2) Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care
(dealers and exhibitors).

(b) Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate
veterinary care that include:

(2) The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday
care

You failed to establish and maintain an adequate program of
veterinary care to include appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of
emergency care. A female takin, “Qiji,” began showing signs of
labor during the afternoon and had a recent history of lethargy,
lameness, and swollen legs. A senior zookeeper contacted the
attending veterinarian that evening but could not reach him. The
zookeeper spoke with the attending veterinarian later that night and
the veterinarian stated that the issue would be dealt with in the
morning. You provided veterinary care to the takin the following
morning. The attending veterinarian euthanized the takin due to
findings discovered during a C-section to remove her fetus, which
had died. You subsequently found that the after-hours vet call list
was out of date.

Date of Violation: November 22, 2014

9 C.F.R. § 3.125(a) Facilities, general.

(a) Structural strength. The facility must be constructed of such material and of
such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor and outdoor
housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

You failed to construct facilities of such material so as to contain the
animals. A female big horn sheep escaped her enclosure by jumping
a wall and a barrier fence. She then escaped the grounds by climbing

a stairway and jumping the perimeter fence. While outside she was
struck by an automobile and died shortly after being recaptured.

Date of Violation: July 2, 2015

9 C.F.R. § 3.75(a) Housing facilities, general.

(a) Structure: construction. Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be
designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the species of
nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they
must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict
other animals from entering.

You failed to design and construct housing facilities for nonhuman
primates that protected them from injury, contained them securely,
and restricted other animals from entering. Two cotton top tamarins
went missing from their exhibit, which was an island-like peninsula
that had several access points, which would pennit entry of other
animals. You identified a surveillance video that showed a bobcat
walking away with one tamarin, and you also found the remains of
one tamarin. You did not find the second missing tamarin.

Date of Violation: March 3, 2016

9 C.F.R. § 3.127(d) Facilities, outdoor.

(d) Perimeter fence. On or after May 17, 2000, all outdoor housing facilities
(i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that
is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. Fences less
than 8 feet high for potentially dangerous animals, such as, but not limited to,
large felines (e.g., lions, tigers, leopards, cougars, etc.), bears, wolves,
rhinoceros, and elephants, or less than 6 feet high for other animals must be
approved in writing by the Administrator. The fence must be constructed so that
it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in
the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for
the animals in the facility. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of
the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside the
enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Such fences less
than 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure must be approved in writing
by the Administrator.

You failed to construct a perimeter fence that protected the animals in
the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from
going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in
the facility. A koala disappeared from her exhibit. The koalas
housed with her that night were unharmed. The design of this
enclosure allows several access points that could permit entry of
unauthorized animals. You found the remains of the missing koala
approximately 300 yards from the exhibit.

Dear Sir or Madam:

We believe that you violated the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. § 2131 et seq.)

by paying an amount that is much lower than the maximum civil penalty.

What are the terms of the Settlement Agreement?

You should review the information in this Settlement Agreement, including the
citation and notification of penalty.

If you agree to waive your right to a hearing and pay the penalty, then do the
following:

o Pay the amount due, $2,750, by September 23, 2016. You can
pay by check, money order, or credit card. For your convenience,
we have included additional instructions for making payments.

o If you are unable to pay the full amount due by September 23,
2016, you may be eligible for a payment plan. To request a
payment plan, you must use the enclosed form to submit a written
response to this letter by September 23, 2016, that indicates you
wish to pay the penalty and waive your right to a hearing. You

CITATION AND NOTIFICATION OF PENALTY

We believe that you violated the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. § 2131 et seq.)
(AWA), as described below.

Date of Violation: Between November 2014 and March 2015

9 C.F.R. § 2.40(b)(3) Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care
(dealers and exhibitors).

(b) Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate
veterinary care that include:

(3) Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being;
Provided, however, that daily observation of animals may be accomplished by
someone other than the attending veterinarian; and Provided, further, That a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and
accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is
conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

You failed to establish a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian. Several wolf hybrids
died between November 2014 and March 2015, most of whom were
humanely euthanized after you took them to a nearby veterinary
clinic for treatment. You did not inform your attending veterinarian
about their conditions, treatments, or deaths in a timely manner.

Date of Violation: December 3, 2014

9 C.F.R. § 3.1(a) Housing facilities, general.

(a) Structure; construction. Housing facilities for dogs and cats must be
designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept
in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury, contain the
animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.

You failed to construct and maintain housing facilities so that they
were structurally sound and protected the animals from injury. You
built eleven shelters on top of pallets to elevate them from the
ground; however, the shelters did not entirely cover the pallets,
leaving large gaps that could injure an animal’s legs and/or feet.

Date of Violation: December 3, 2014

9 C.F_R. § 3.1(e) Housing facilities, general.

(e) Storage. Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that
protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. The
supplies must be stored off the floor and away from the walls, to allow cleaning
underneath and around the supplies. Foods requiring refrigeration must be
stored accordingly, and all food must be stored in a manner that prevents
contamination and deterioration of its nutritive value. All open supplies of food
and bedding must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to
prevent contamination and spoilage. Only food and bedding that is currently
being used may be kept in the animal areas. Substances that are toxic to the
dogs or cats but are required for normal husbandry practices must not be stored
in food storage and preparation areas, but may be stored in cabinets in the
animal areas.

You failed to store and maintain animal food in a manner that
protected it from spoilage and contamination. APHIS observed:
1) A freezer where meat was stored needed to be cleaned.

2) A lack of organization in one freezer of the new and older meat.
3) Knives used to cut meat had bits of meat still on them and the
cutting board was covered in blood and other liquids.

Date of Violation: December 3, 2014

9 C.F.R. § 3.4(b)(3) Outdoor housing facilities.

(b) Shelter from the elements. Outdoor facilities for dogs or cats must include
one or more shelter structures that are accessible to each animal in each outdoor
facility, and that are large enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure
to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. In addition to
the shelter structures, one or more separate outside areas of shade must be
provided, large enough to contain all the animals at one time and protect them
from the direct rays of the sun. Shelters in outdoor facilities for dogs or cats
must contain a roof, four sides, and a floor, and must:

(3) Be provided with a wind break and rain break at the entrance

You failed to provide shelters with a wind and rain break at the
entrance. None of the wooden shelters had wind and rain breaks.

Date of Violation: December 3, 2014

9 C.F.R. § 3.11(c) Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
(c) Housekeeping for premises. Premises where housing facilities are located,
including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in good

repair to protect the animals from injury, to facilitate the husbandry practices
required in this subpart, and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for
rodents and other pests and vermin. Premises must be kept free of
accumulations of trash, junk, waste products, and discarded matter. Weeds,
grasses, and bushes must be controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the
premises and pest control, and to protect the health and well-being of the
animals.

You failed to keep the premises free of accumulations of trash, junk,
waste products, and discarded matter. Debris from meat packs was
strewn across the ground outside the food preparation area.

Date of Violation: On or about February 14-24, 2015

9 C.F.R. § 2.40(b)(3) Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care
(dealers and exhibitors).

(b) Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate
veterinary care that include:

(3) Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being;
Provided, however, that daily observation of animals may be accomplished by
someone other than the attending veterinarian; and Provided, further, That a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and
accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is
conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

You failed to establish a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian. You observed that
Tahzay, a 13-15 year old male wolf dog hybrid, was gagging,
drooling, and vomiting, and was not eating. You brought him inside
for observation and to feed him a bland diet, but did not contact your
attending veterinarian. On February 16, 2015, you took him to a
nearby veterinary clinic because he was gagging, vomiting, and not
eating. The veterinarian prescribed an antibiotic and an anti-nausea
medication and you brought him back to your facility. On February
24, 2015, you took Tahzay back to the veterinary clinic after he did
not respond to the medications and his condition declined. Due to his
age and poor health, Tahzay was euthanized. You did not notify the
attending veterinarian about Tahzay’s condition during his illness.

Date of Violation: March 24, 2015

9 C.F.R. § 3.11(c) Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

(c) Housekeeping for premises. Premises where housing facilities are located,
including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in good

required in this subpart, and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for

premises and pest control, and to protect the health and well-being of the

You failed to control weeds, grasses, and bushes. Twelve of the
older, non-updated large enclosures of dog hybrids had excessively
dense trees and shrubs.

The penalty for the alleged violation(s) described above is $2,750.

Re: Reference number OH150007-AC
Dear Mr. McGuire:

We believe that you violated the Animal Welfare Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2131 ef seq.
(“AWA”), as described in the enclosed Settlement Agreement. Our agency, the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), is responsible for enforcing
the AWA to ensure the welfare of animals.

Violations of the AWA can have serious and costly impacts, detrimental to
animals and the public interest. After providing you with an opportunity for a
hearing, we may pursue civil penalties of up to $10,000, or other sanctions, for
each violation described in this Settlement Agreement. However, instead of
pursuing a civil penalty or other sanctions at this time, we are offering you the
opportunity to resolve this matter by agreeing to meet the terms specified in the
enclosed Settlement Agreement.

What are the terms of the Settlement Agreement?

Briefly, the Settlement Agreement provides that APHIS will not initiate formal
enforcement action for the alleged violations outlined in the Settlement
Agreement, if:

i. You agree to a revocation of your AWA license, and permanent
disqualification from obtaining an AWA license in the future.

2 You agree to sell, donate, and/or transfer ownership of your regulated
animals within 12 weeks from the date you sign the Settlement
Agreement. You will need to request a one-time exemption from the
licensing requirements to disperse your regulated animals if you 1) do
not currently hold a license, or 2) disperse them after signing this
Settlement Agreement. You may also request an exemption to retain a

an exemption, you should contact Teany Gerkin with Animal Care at

ownership of your regulated animals (other than animals for which you
request an exemption) within the 12-week period, by allowing Animal
Care to take an inventory of the regulated animals present at your
facility and providing Animal Care with ownership transfer records.

4. You acknowledge that the Secretary has jurisdiction over activities
govermmed by the AWA and waive your opportunity for a hearing in this
matter.

5. You agree that your failure to comply with the terms of the Settlement

Agreement will void the Settlement Agreement, and allow APHIS to
pursue any and all remedies and sanctions.

The above is a summary of the terms in the Settlement Agreement. You should
review the Settlement Agreement in its entirety.

When must I respond?

If you agree to meet the terms of the Settlement Agreement, sign the Settlement
Agreement and send it to our office by June 17, 2016: USDA, APHIS, IES

(b)(1) Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as
possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive
cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

You failed to handle animals as carefully as possible. Five of forty
guinea pigs died when staff members stacked several enclosures on
top of each other and transferred them from one room to another.

as an agent of the research facility, shall:

(7) Review and approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or
withhold approval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of
animals in ongoing activities.

You failed to secure IACUC approval prior to making significant
changes regarding the care and use of animals used in ongoing
activities. Protocols 1507043 and 1507044 indicated that you would
increase animal observations at the onset of clinical signs, but forty-
nine animal records did not document these increased observations.
In addition, the scoring sheet used to record animal observations did
not correlate with the project specific scoring sheet approved for use
in these protocols.

someone other than the attending veterinarian; and Provided, further, That a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and
accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is
conveyed to the attending veterinarian

You failed to provide direct and frequent communications to the
attending veterinarian. Staff members did not notify the attending
veterinarian when nine of twenty-five guinea pigs used during
protocol 1507043 died. The protocol stated death was not the end
point of the study.

Date of Violation: On or about December 4-12, 2015

someone other than the attending veterinarian; and Provided, further, That a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and
accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is

(b)(1) Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as
possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive
cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

members moved a sheep from one enclosure to another enclosure, the
sheep jumped over the temporary ramp used to facilitate the

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has evidence that on or about the date(s) listed

laws:

Date of Alleged Violation: June 18-19, 2015
9 C.F.R. § 2.131(b)(1) Handling of Animals.

You failed to handle animals as carefully as possible in a manner that did not
cause trauma, overheating, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary
discomfort. A shipment of four adult sugar gliders were scheduled for
transport by a carrier, in commerce, from Charlotte-Douglas International
Airport (CLT), routed through Chicago, Illinois (ORD), with a final
destination of Charleston, West Virginia (CRW). The carrier did not load the
animals onto their originally-scheduled flight from CLT to ORD, and
subsequently transported them on a later flight to ORD. Due to the missed
flight and weather-related delays, the sugar gliders did not make their
connection to CRW, and the carrier delivered them to you for holding
overnight at ORD. You did not visually observe the sugar gliders or provide
them with food or water. The sugar gliders resumed transit on a flight from
ORD to CRW the following day, and the consignee discovered that they were
dead when she picked them up at CRW. The necropsy performed on the sugar
gliders indicated that they died from probable heat stroke.
