FACILITIES, GENERAL.

** There was a rabbit that was outside of the rabbit box but inside the barn during the inspection. This rabbit belongs
in the enclosure but was able to hop out. The animals shall be contained in an enclosure that is structurally sound
and designed to adequately contain that species to prevent them from being injured or harmed.

3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.

*** In the ring tail lemurs enclosure on the floor there was a pile of old feces that had not been picked up in a couple
of days. Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized to
prevent accumulation of excreta or disease hazards. If the species scent mark, the surfaces must be sanitized or
replaced at regular intervals. Contaminated material must be removed or replaced whenever raking and spot
cleaning does not eliminate odors, diseases, insects, pests, or vermin infestation. All other surfaces of housing
facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and
practices. Correct by February 21 ,2017.

3.125(a) CRITICAL REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.

*** The enclosure containing the arctic foxes had been penetrated from within on February 9, 2017. The foxes
burrowed out of the enclosure and escaped the facility. They burrowed down beneath their den at least two feet and
out of the enclosure about 3 - 4 feet passed the fence line. Three days later one fox returned with mild seizures and
was treated by the Attending Veterinarian immediately. The second fox returned the next day with a broken right
rear foot which was also treated by the Attending Veterinarian promptly. Five of the remaining foxes have not
returned and the facility has laid traps and bait to attempt to catch them. The facility has revamped the enclosure by
extending the fence vertically 4 - 5 ft below the ground into concrete to prevent the current foxes from escaping. The
facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.

Four chimps escaped from their enclosure on QQHQNMIQ) 2017. An animal keeper observed the chimps out of
their enclosure and followed the emergency procedures to notify the staff and clear out the compound immediately.
The facility representative stated the chimps did not venture far from their housing area and were safely returned to
their enclosure without incidence to the animals or facility personnel.

The facility’s investigation of the incident revealed the primary and secondary locks to the chimp’s primary enclosure
were broken. The facility representative stated the chimps had access to the locks and were able to manipulate and
break them.

Enclosure locks, chains, and other devices/ mechanisms must adequately and securely contain the animals and be
maintained to minimize the risk of harm to animals or persons.

Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for
the species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and contain the animals. A
system should be in place to ensure locks used to secure animal enclosures are constructed of materials and
strength appropriate for the age and species of animal.

The facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation and implementing corrective

actions to prevent future occurrences.
This incident was self-reported and has been corrected by the facility

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.

* "Polly," a 3 year old English Bulldog, (ID# [BY had a one inch wide spot on her right front leg that was
raised about a quarter of an inch. The licensee reported that this was caused another dog biting her days before.
When the swollen area was lightly touched, a pale liquid followed by a reddish clear liquid came out of the open
wound in the center of the swollen area. The licensee reported that this dog was not being treated for wounds and
hadn't thought that the wound was, 'that bad.’ Swollen, untreated wounds that have pale discharge and reddish clear
discharge can be painful and may lead to further health problems if not treated.

The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian on this swollen wound in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document this
information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care at all times.

* The following medications were past the labeled expiration date or had no expiration date: Oxytocin Injection no
date, Oxytocin Injection - 7/2014, Draxxin -1 Feb 2014, Cabergoline 125 mg 7/12/15, Cabergoline 120 mg 7/1/2014,

These medications were intermingled with other products on the medication counter top that are currently being used
at the facility and are therefore ready for use. Expired drugs and drugs with no known certainty of the expiration date
may not work as anticipated, could become contaminated, and could harm the animals. The licensee must ensure
that all medications used in the facility are not expired, labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary
practices, and are stored in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. This will promote the health of 31
adult dogs and 27 puppies.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.

* There were bottles of medication had an accumulation of grey to brown dust and debris on top and sides of the
bottles. These 11 bottles of medication were stored on the medication counter top with other products and therefore
ready for use. This can soil or contaminate the medication affecting the health of the dogs the medication is used for.

All medications must be stored in an area that is kept clean and in a manner that prevents an accumulation of dust
and debris on the bottles. This will prevent contamination and ensure the quality of the medications used on the 31
adult and 27 puppies.

To be corrected by, 18-July-2016.

3.1 (C) (1) i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.

* In the whelping barn, all the raised whelping enclosures had two horizontal support bars between the sections of
flooring per enclosure. These metal bars were extremely rusty and corroding. This can affect the structural strength
of the supports and possibly injure the animals. These surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized increasing
the disease potential.

All metal surfaces must be free of excessive rust that affects the structural strength and prevents the required
cleaning and sanitization. This will minimize injury, and allows for proper cleaning and sanitization decreasing the
disease potential for five adults and 27 puppies.

To be corrected by, 30-August-2016.

3.1 (c) (2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.

* The concrete flooring in the Main Kennel and Hip Roof shed had wet areas on the flooring. These wet areas where
not drying off. This indicates the water or fluid waste was being absorbed by the concrete.

* In the whelping barn, all the enclosures had orange hog flooring. The orange vinyl had come off the flooring, in
areas, exposing bare metal in these enclosures. This was along the edge of the flooring. In these areas, the metal
was extremely rusty and corroded. This allows for waste and germs to get into these areas.

* In the Hip Roof Shed, to the left of the door, two enclosures had a plastic panels for the back wall and a plastic
panel divider. These plastic panels and divider were excessively scratched and chewed in areas. There was greyish
dirt and debris is these scratched and chewed areas. To the left of the door, three enclosures had approximately % to
Ya inch wide by 4 feet long gaps between the panels on the back wall.

This allows for waste and germs to get in between the panels.

All these above mentioned surfaces are not being maintained and cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Surfaces
that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized increases the disease potential for the 31 adult dogs and 27 puppies.

All surfaces must be maintained when worn or soiled. This allows for surfaces to be readily cleaned and sanitized.
Thus, decreasing the disease potential for the dogs.

To be corrected by, 15-August-2016.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.

* To the right of the door in the Hip Shed, enclosures one through three had an accumulation of hair and damp
reddish-brown waste on top of the concrete flooring.

To the left of the door, two enclosures had chewed or scratched areas in the back wall and a plastic divider board.
These chewed and scratched areas had an accumulation of grey dirt or debris. This indicates that daily spot-cleaning
and sanitization is not taking place. As a result, this can increase the disease hazards for the 10 adult dogs.

All hard surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized often enough for the prevention of disease hazards.

3.1 (f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.

* The Hip Roof shed had standing waste water in an area approximately 1 and 1/2 feet wide by 4 feet long at the end
of the center drainage gutter (alleyway). This waste water can attract insects, pests and increase odors and disease
hazards. Thus, this can affect the health of 10 adult dogs.

Housing facilities drainage systems must rapidly eliminate animal waste and fluid waste. This will minimize insects,
pest, odors and disease hazards for the dogs.

To be corrected by, 10-August-2016.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).

There is still a bottle of injectable Telazol and a bottle of Zetamine (Ketamine) in the medication area of the storage
building. The licensee stated this medication is used to sedate the animals but had no documentation showing written
instructions from the attending veterinarian on its directions for appropriate use, the indications for its use, or
precautions needed to be taken during its use. The licensee must ensure that all medications are used in a manner
consistent with the provision of adequate veterinary care to protect the health of the animals and ensure drugs are
used in an appropriate manner. The licensee must obtain written approval from their attending or prescribing
veterinarian if they wish to continue to use Telazol and Zetamine to sedate animals. This documentation must
minimally contain information regarding exact indications and situations for use, dosing instructions for all specific
animals for which these drugs may be used (route, concentration, dose, etc.), and guidance regarding appropriate
monitoring and recovery of animals. All medications must be labeled and administered properly as part of the facility's
programs of adequate veterinary care.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.

The resting surfaces, climbing ladders, and some spots on the walls in two sheltered capuchin enclosures were
visibly soiled. The licensee states that these were last sprayed clean about 2 weeks ago. There was also an
accumulation of feces in the indoor section of another sheltered capuchin enclosure. The licensee states the feces
were last removed from this enclosure two days ago. Failure to clean hard surfaces with which nonhuman primate
come into contact can result in odors, attraction of pests, and general unsanitary conditions and can also play a role
in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that all hard surfaces that nonhuman primates come into contact
with are spot cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.84 of subpart F to prevent accumulation of excreta or
disease hazard. If species scent mark, the surfaces must be sanitized or replaced at regular intervals as determined
by the attending veterinarian in accordance with generally accepted professional and husbandry practices. Correct

FACILITIES, GENERAL.

The wooden lower front section of a shelter used for 2 addax has several sections missing. Some of these sections
are approximately 10 X12. In another enclosure housing 2 addax there is a section of fabric fence material that has
come loose from the wire enclosure fence. Housing enclosures that are not kept in good repair can result in injury to
the animals. All building materials must be constructed of materials that are structurally appropriate for the animals
and must be maintained and kept in good repair.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.

The area around the water receptacles for the zebras and for the deer has mud and standing water. These animals
cannot approach the water receptacles without walking through the mud and standing water. Standing water and
mud can also attract pests and can lead to an increase in disease transmission. A suitable method must be
established to rapidly eliminate excess water.

This routine inspection was conducted on i 201 5 with facility representatives as well as Dr. Margaret Shaver,

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).

The program of veterinary care form states that the arctic foxes are to be treated monthly with Frontline for
ectoparasites. The licensee has other written instructions from the attending veterinarian as of 25 May 2016 to use
NexGard for the foxes for flea control at least through August. The licensee states that one arctic fox was treated with
NexGard at the time it was recommended in May but has not been given the NexGard or Frontline since. Failure to
follow the program of veterinary care and other written directions from the attending veterinarian can result ina
variety of medical and husbandry problems for the animals. The licensee must use appropriate methods to control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries as directed by the attending veterinarian.

The resting surfaces, climbing ladders, and some spots on the walls in two sheltered capuchin enclosures were still
visibly soiled. The licensee states that these were last sprayed clean about 2 weeks ago. There was also an
accumulation of feces in the indoor section of one sheltered black-and-white lemur enclosure. The licensee states the
feces were last removed from this enclosure two days ago. Failure to clean hard surfaces with which nonhuman
primate come into contact can result in odors, attraction of pests, and general unsanitary conditions and can also
play a role in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that all hard surfaces that nonhuman primates come

-The "colobus" building had the following ambient temperatures in degrees F: 87.7 at 1:52 pm; 87.1 at 3:09 pm, and
88.2 at 6:32.

Inability to protect the nonhuman primates from temperature extremes can result in discomfort for the animals and
inability to maintain a safe body temperature. The licensee must ensure that the sheltered housing facilities be
sufficiently heated and cooled when necessary to protect the nonhuman primates from temperature extremes. The
ambient temperature in the sheltered part of the facility must not rise above 85 degrees F for more than 4 consecutive
hours when nonhuman primates are present unless temperatures above 85 degrees are approved by the attending
veterinarian. Correct by 7 August 2016.

plan written by the licensee states that the Pata's monkey will be housed in pairs. There are no special considerations
in the environmental enhancement plan to address the needs of this individually housed animal. The licensee must
ensure that the environmental enhancement plan outlines the special attention regarding the enhancement of the
environment of individually housed nonhuman primates that are unable to see and hear nonhuman primate species
of their own or compatible species. Correct by 1 Sept. 2016.

The special considerations in the Environmental Enhancement plan for the individually housed colobus states “If
housed alone then they have mirrors to reflect the impression of the other primates near them and/or recorded
vocalizations of additional species. In addition they are provided additional foraging items to challenge them.”
During the inspection, the one individually housed black and white colobus at the facility was confined to the indoor
portion of this sheltered enclosure and while he had a mirror reflecting back at himself, it was not allowing him to
view other primates and he was not provided with recorded vocalizations. There was food in the enclosure but no

There is an exposed metal edge in the feed bunk located in the indoor portion of the camel barn.

There is a jagged metal edge near the upper side of a round bale feeder, last used as a tree ring in the deer
enclosure.

The zebras had access through an opened gate to a storage area that had used metal cages, metal panels, barrels,
branches and other debris. In addition, there were numerous strands of baling twine and sections of hoses
scattered throughout the vicinity immediately in front of and inside the zebra shelter.

Jagged metal edges and discarded material could pose an injury threat to the animals. All facilities must be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Correct by 15 Feb. 2017.

SANITATION.

There is an excessive accumulation of feces in the chinchilla enclosures. The licensee states these are cleaned on
a weekly basis. Feces and food residue were observed scattered across the floor. This waste covered the majority
of the floor surfaces. Excessive feces can contaminate the animals and increase disease transmission. Feces
must be removed from enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and minimize
disease hazards. Correct by 9 February 2017.

*** An adult female Siberian Husky named Snowflake (m/ ATS) was very thin. The outlines of the ribs
and vertebrae were clearly visible and the hip bones were protruding. This dog was nursing 8 puppies that were
about 4 weeks old. The dog's diet consisted of free choice adult dog food. Poor body condition can be a result of
inadequate nutrition, parasites, or an underlying medical condition. The licensee must consult a veterinarian about
this dog's condition, follow the veterinarian's instructions, and be able to produce written documentation upon
request by the inspector.

***The licensee had dog vaccines that had expired August 25, 2015. These vaccines were stored with her other
vaccines and were ready for use. Expired medications or vaccines can lose their effectiveness and their ability to
prevent or control disease and/or pain. The licensee must ensure that all medications and vaccines are within their
expiration dates at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.

a) Structure; construction.

An adult, male Cocker Spaniel was discovered missing from the facility 15 days prior to the inspection and had not
been found. It was last seen in the exercise pen. One of the gates in the exercise pen had a gap so wide (6-8
inches) that the latch was no longer functional. The licensee had placed a piece of plastic over the gap; however,
during the inspection the gate was not secured and easily swung open. Housing facilities that are not structurally
sound can allow animals to escape. The licensee must ensure that all housing and fencing are structurally sound
and will contain the animals securely.

3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3) Cleaning.

Most of the sheltered enclosures had an excessive amount of fecal matter in the outdoor portion of the enclosures.
The licensee uses gravel as ground cover. It had rained the night before and the fecal matter was mixed into the
gravel. Many of the dogs were not able to avoid stepping in feces. The licensee stated the fecal matter had not been
removed from these enclosures since Monday (4 days earlier). The feces in one pen was dried and covered in
mold. Enclosures which are not properly cleaned and sanitized pose a health risk to the dogs because they contain
microorganisms which can cause disease. The licensee must remove waste from enclosures on a daily basis and
replace contaminated gravel floors whenever spot cleaning is not sufficient to eliminate fecal matter.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.

An adult female Poodle named Posey was lying on her side in an enclosure with three other adult dogs. She did
not move her legs or appear able to rise. When the licensee attempted to pick her up she appeared painful and
snapped at the licensee who had to wrap her in a towel to be able to pick her up. Even when she was removed
from the enclosure, the dog made no effort to stand or use her legs. There was blood covering the back half of her
body and what appeared to be bite wounds on her legs and back. Dogs may be injured when housed with more
dominant or aggressive dogs. The licensee must ensure that dogs housed together in the same enclosure are
compatible.

Cleaning of primary enclosures.

****There was a strong odor of urine and feces in the whelping area located in the red building. Most of the
catch-pans under the dog enclosures with grill-type floors contained a lot of urine and feces. The feces under one
pen was dried and was covered in hair, indicating that the pan had not been emptied and cleaned for quite a while.

****Many of the outdoor portions of the sheltered facilities had an excessive amount of feces on the concrete
flooring. Two of these enclosures had so much feces that the dogs could not avoid stepping in the feces and had
fecal matter on their feet.

****During the inspection, the licensee sprayed water with a hose into an enclosure to clean the flooring. The spray
from the hose wetted the dogs inside the enclosure.

Excessive feces and urine can be a disease hazard, can cause odors, and can attract insects and other pests. The
licensee must clean the primary enclosures and the pans underneath them as often as necessary to prevent an

Nubs, an 11 year old, neutered, male pit bull:

- There was an approximately 2cmX 2.5cm sized reddened, deep, ulcerated skin lesion located above the nail bed
of the 3rd toe of the left front foot. The lesion appears moist with a mild to moderate amount of a yellowish-tan
discoloration of the tissue. The lower half of this toe and the lower half of the adjacent 4th toe both appear to have
a reddened and swollen appearance. Also, the upper portions of the toenails of both these toes have a dark,
brownish discoloration near the nail beds. Because these toes are used for normal weight-bearing in dogs, any
medical condition affecting these toes may increase the potential to cause pain or discomfort to the animal.
Additionally, open, untreated skin lesions or wounds located in this area may be more susceptible to contamination
and infection. At time of inspection, there was no observed lameness or licking/chewing at any of the toes. The
licensee stated that he noticed this lesion about two days ago and the dog has not been examined by a
veterinarian.

-There was a quarter-sized area of hair loss with thickened, brownish colored skin located on the right hip. The skin
surrounding this area was slightly reddened and inflamed, and the hair in the area was wet with brownish staining.
The inspector observed the dog actively licking this area at time of inspection. The licensee stated he had not
noticed this area of irritated skin, but he indicated that this dog has had a long history of chronic skin issues.

Skin conditions such as open sores/lesions or wounds, as well as, swollen toes could cause pain and discomfort to
the animals and could lead to further health problems. The licensee called the attending veterinarian to set an
appointment at time of inspection.

This dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and
an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and
resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. This dog must
be evaluated by a veterinarian by close of business on 03/06/2017.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.

The floors, walls and doors on the outside portion of the primary enclosures were moderately worn. The primary
enclosures in this area are constructed of primarily of coated wire. The wire coating has been worn or chewed off
over portions of the floors, walls and doors. In the majority of these areas the exposed wire is rusted. These areas
of the kennel are no longer in good repair. The areas where the coating is damaged provide crevices that organic
material can become entrapped preventing adequate cleaning and sanitation. Additionally, the rust which has
formed over the exposed wires also prevents them from being readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by repairing or
replacing these damaged areas. All surfaces in contact with the dogs must be readily cleaned and sanitized in
accordance with Sec. 3.11 (b) of this subpart, or be replaceable when worn or soiled.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.

Adult female bulldog named "Panda" microchip number SEE Was found at the time of inspection to be
tethered to a tree in the Licensee's front yard. This animal had shade and was not found to be tangled in the tether.
The animal appeared to be comfortable and in good health. Dogs tethered may become tangled or they may get
loose from the tether and become harmed. Tethering as a form of exercise needs to be approved by the attending
veterinarian as well as by USDA APHIS Animal Care. Temporary tethering of dogs is prohibited unless prior
approval is obtained from APHIS.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.

During the inspection it was noted that the wash-down areas had a heavy buildup of tan matter. There was a
moderate amount of feces and urine present within the wash down area. This buildup is an indicator of dried urine
and feces that has built up over time. Improper cleaning and sanitization of the wash down contributes to the odor
and disease hazards within the facility. This facility must establish and maintain a routine for proper cleaning and
sanitation for the facility to include all wash downs.
