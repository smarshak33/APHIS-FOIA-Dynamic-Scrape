The inspector arrived at the facility at 13:25 hrs and was greeted by a family member of the licensee who stated the
licensee was currently away. The family member reportedly called the licensee and he stated he could conduct the
inspection in one hour. The inspector waited over an hour, left three voicemail messages for the licensee, and finally left
the property after waiting 87 minutes without any direct contact with or sign of the licensee. The licensee called the
inspector from home at 15:24 hrs to apologize for missing the inspection and stated he was available, but the inspector

was already inspecting a different facility by that time.

Vials of Parvovirus vaccine have been stored in a cabinet in the kennel overnight and are still in the cabinet at
approximately 2 pm the next day. At the time of the inspection the temperature in the kennel was 57 degrees F. The
label on the vaccines states that the vaccines should be stored at 35-45 degrees F. Failure to store vaccines at the
proper temperature could affect their ability to adequately protect the dogs from disease.

The facility must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The Parvovirus

vaccines must be moved to a storage area that is the proper temperature in order to ensure the health of the animals.

This inspection was an announced site approval inspection. This site is not ready for approval to conduct activity covered
under your current Animal Welfare Act License.

Conducting regulated activities at a non-approved site is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act. Please contact your
inspector to schedule your next new site approval inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.

2.1(a)(1)
Requirements and application.

The licensee holds a Class “A” license to sell dogs born and raised on his premises. The licensee acquired nine French
bulldog puppies that were not born and raised on his premises and then resold them. Selling puppies that were not born
and raised on the licensee’s premises is not an activity that is allowed to be conducted under a Class “A” license.
Purchasing and reselling animals not born and raised on the premises (“brokering”) requires a Class “B” license.
Conducting regulated activity without a valid USDA license is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act. The licensee must
either obtain a Class “B” license in order to sell dogs born and raised on other properties or the licensee must ensure he

conducts only activities that are allowed under a Class “A” license.

To be corrected by: The licensee was instructed at the time of the inspection, and during the exit briefing, that proceeding
with conducting any brokering activities without a valid USDA “B” license will continue to be a violation of the Animal
Welfare Act.

left ears. A large section of tightly matted hair is located on the exterior surface of both the left and right ear and is tight
against the skin. Large clumps of grey colored tightly matted hair are attached to the top and bottom of both hind feet.
The inspector had to pull the hair apart in order to identify the dog’s toenails. Severely matted hair coats could cause pain

and discomfort to the animal as well as lead to further health issues.

Each dealer must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat injuries and illnesses. The licensee
must have all the matted hair removed from this dog’s hair coat. The licensee must ensure that the hair coats of all dogs
remain free of matted hair at all times in order to support their health and well-being.

The licensee sold 43 puppies that do not have their breeds documented on the disposition form. The term “Unlisted
Breed” is used in column F on the disposition form in place of the actual breed. At least 13 additional puppies have the
wrong breed listed in column F of their disposition forms. The licensee stated that some of these puppies were cross
breeds that were not in the computer system used to input the information on the form, but APHIS Form 7006, Record of
Disposition of Dogs and Cats, states that if the animal is a mixed breed then list the 2 dominant breeds. Failure to
document the correct breed on the disposition form can interfere with APHIS official’s ability to properly identify animals

and to trace animals to their destinations.

Disposition information must include a description of each dog including the dog’s breed. The licensee must ensure that
all disposition forms include the correct breed of dog.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.

The licensee is not using APHIS Form 7005, Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand, to document the required
acquisition information for at least 171 adult dogs on the premises. The licensee is using APHIS Form 7019, Record of
Animals on Hand (Other than Dogs and Cats) to document the acquisition information for each dog. During a courtesy
visit to the facility on 03-March-2021, the inspector provided the licensee with APHIS Form 7005, but the licensee has

failed to input the information for each dog onto the form by the time of the inspection.

Failure to use APHIS Form 7005 does not ensure that the necessary information is documented for each dog which could

interfere with APHIS official's ability to identify dogs and trace the animals back to their locations of origin.

Each dealer shall use Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS Form 7005) to make, keep, and maintain

all required information. The licensee must complete APHIS Form 7005 with the necessary information for each dog

residing on the premises. The licensee must ensure that APHIS Form 7005 is completed for all dogs that are acquired.

The licensee destroyed the acquisition information (cage cards) for 505 puppies. Failure to maintain the acquisition
information for the required amount of time could interfere with APHIS official’s ability to properly identify and trace
animals.

No dealer, exhibitor, broker, operator of an auction, carrier, or intermediate handler shall, for a period of 1 year, destroy or
dispose of, without the consent in writing of the Administration, any books, records, documents, or other papers required
to be kept and maintained. The licensee must maintain all acquisition information, including cage cards, for all adult dogs
and puppies. The licensee must ensure that all required documents are kept for at least one year after the final
disposition of the animal.

3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.

Within the sheltered housing building there are 3 enclosures, containing a total of 3 adult dogs and 13 puppies, that have
an opening cut in the fencing that will accommodate a self-feeder. The opening is located along the floor and did not
contain self-feeders at the time of the inspection. The openings are large enough to allow a puppy to escape from the
enclosure and one puppy was observed placing his head through the opening. Failure of the enclosure to contain the

animals could result in injury, inability to access food and water, and even death.

Housing facilities for dogs must protect the animals from injuries and contain the animals securely. The licensee must
alter the enclosures in a manner that removes the openings and eliminates the ability of the puppies to escape. The
licensee must ensure that all enclosures contain the animals securely at all times.

3.1(c)(1)(ii)
Housing facilities, general.
Inside the sheltered housing building, enclosures #13, #14, #15, and #16 each have a self-feeder attached to the front

gate with twisted wire. The sharp ends of the wire are protruding into the enclosure and are located at the level of the

dogs. The inspectors observed the dogs coming into direct contact with these sharp points.

One covered outdoor enclosure, containing 3 dogs, has a dog igloo that serves as the shelter. The shelter no longer
contains a wind and rain break at the entrance, but part of its metal door frame is still attached to the shelter opening.

The metal frame has broken and created a sharp point at the level of the dogs.

In one enclosure, containing 1 adult dog and 3 puppies, the sharp ends of metal screws are protruding into the interior of

the whelping box and are located at the level of the adult dog.

The sharp points created by the twisted wire, broken door frame, and metal screws could cause injury to the animals.

Housing facilities must be free of sharp points and jagged edges that could injure the animals. The licensee must either
remove the broken metal door frame, twisted wire, and sharp ends of the screws or alter them in a manner that eliminates
the risk of injury to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures remain safe for the dogs at all times.

waste to the end of the building.

As the two pipes exit the indoor housing area they drain onto a small ledge along the backside of the dog enclosures and
the waste material runs down the wall to the floor of the enclosures, causing an accumulation of wet fecal material and
contaminated liquid waste on the ledge and walls and a buildup of solid fecal material between the wall and the flooring in
the back of the enclosures and along one side of one of the enclosures. The enclosure that has a heavy accumulation of
fecal material built up along both walls has a very strong odor. Approximately 8 dogs in these covered outdoor
enclosures are directly exposed to this contaminated water and fecal material. In one of the enclosures there was rodent

fecal material on the ledge, indicating that they are feeding on the accumulated waste material.

Waste from the sheltered enclosures is washed into a gutter system that drains to the outside through a corner of the
building. There is a large pile of fecal material and organic waste outside the building where the gutter empties.
Wastewater and rainwater flow through this pile and into another outdoor enclosure housing approximately 11 dogs which

were observed by the inspectors to be standing and walking in it.

Housing facility operators must provide for the removal, and disposal of animal and food wastes and other fluids and

wastes in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks. The dogs in this situation are directly exposed to the
fecal contaminated waste of many other dogs. This greatly increases the possibility of spreading parasites and infectious

Outdoor housing facilities.

Five large outdoor enclosures that house approximately 40 dogs, have insufficient shade or shelter for the dogs they
house. Two enclosures, housing a total of approximately 20 dogs, have an insufficient shade structure to contain all the
dogs at one time and protect them from the direct rays of the sun. Many of these are large, heavy coated breeds and in
the last week there have been two days where the outdoor temperature exceeded 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The shade
that is present in these enclosures is provided by rectangular sheets of metal roofing tied onto the corner of the

enclosures.

Two enclosures, housing a total of approximately 12 dogs, have no shade at all. The licensee stated that he has ordered

shade structures for these enclosures, but they are not yet completed at the time of the inspection.

Sufficient shade to provide protection from prolonged exposure to the harmful rays of the sun is essential for the welfare
of all animals. Prolonged exposure can easily cause heat stress, and in extreme cases, heat stroke that can lead to

death. Large, heavy coated breeds that still have their full winter coats at this time of year are particularly vulnerable.

One or more separate outside areas of shade that are large enough to contain all the animals at one time and protect
them from the direct rays of the sun must be provided in each enclosure. The licensee must ensure that all outdoor

enclosures contain an adequate amount of shaded areas at all times.

To be corrected by: April 17, 2021

At least 5 of the covered outdoor enclosures, housing a total of 25 dogs, do not have a shelter that is large enough to
accommodate all the dogs in the enclosure compliantly. In addition, 3 outdoor enclosures, housing a total of
approximately 20 dogs, do not have a shelter that is large enough to accommodate all the dogs in the enclosure
compliantly. In all 8 of these affected enclosures there is not enough shelter space to allow all the dogs to sit, stand, and
lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. Failure to provide sufficient shelter space may result in the inability of a

dog to escape adverse weather conditions and the health and well-being of the animal could suffer.

Outdoor enclosures must include one or more shelter structures that are accessible to each animal and that are large
enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. The
licensee must either alter the current shelters in a manner that will provide adequate space for each dog or provide
enough compliant shelters to accommodate the number of dogs in each enclosure. The licensee must ensure that all
outdoor enclosures contain shelters that provide sufficient space for the dogs at all times.

Outdoor housing facilities.

Three of the large outdoor enclosures, housing a total of approximately 23 dogs, do not have adequate wind and rain
breaks at the entrances to their shelters to keep out wind and rain. All these shelters have tattered pieces of what appears
to be a burlap type material at the entrances that served as wind and rain breaks. The temperatures during the previous

week had ranged from the 40s to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

Inspection Report

All dogs housed outdoors need to have access to adequate protection from wind, rain, snow and temperature extremes.
The lack of adequate wind and rain breaks on these shelters could expose dogs to the elements and temperature

extremes that can profoundly impact their physical and emotional wellbeing and lead to illness.

All shelters must have adequate wind and rain breaks at the entrance. The licensee must add wind and rain breaks to the
entrances of the affected shelters and ensure that all outdoor shelters have a wind and rain break at all times.

To be corrected by: April 17, 2021

3.4(b)(4)

Outdoor housing facilities.

In one outdoor enclosure, housing 11 dogs, the shelter has insufficient bedding material. A thin layer of straw is covering
approximately a quarter of the floor space inside the shelter and the rest of the floor is completely devoid of bedding
material. At least 2 covered outdoor enclosures, containing a total of 9 dogs, each have a shelter with either no bedding
material at all or just a few strands of straw. Temperatures below 50 degrees Fahrenheit had been experienced in this
location in the previous three days and were forecast in the next 12 hours. The licensee was unaware that the shelters

were lacking bedding material.

For dogs housed outdoors, protection from the cold and extreme temperatures in essential for wellbeing and an important

part of protection from physical stress and disease.

Shelters in outdoor enclosures must contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 °F (10
°C). Additional clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 °F (1.7 °C) or lower. The licensee must add

sufficient bedding to the affected shelters and ensure all shelters contain bedding when the ambient temperatures require

it.

Correction date: The licensee was notified that the shelters required bedding at the time of the inspection (April 7, 2021)
and was reminded during the exit interview that all outdoor shelters must have bedding every time the temperature drops
below 50 degrees Fahrenheit.

3.11(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

One of the empty enclosures in the covered outdoor area is being used to store housing materials and has an
accumulation of trash, organic material, and dirty or discarded food or water bowls. There was a pile of dirt and organic
waste material in the aisle outside the enclosure along with multiple small sections of unused flooring, and a dead rat was

lying on the ground a few feet away.

In the outdoor areas, there are many pieces of white and blue plastic bags littered around the 6 large outdoor enclosures
housing more than 40 dogs. One of the enclosures, housing 4 dogs, has an approximately 2 to 3-foot piece of blue
plastic caught in the fence and extending into the enclosure. Another enclosure with 8 dogs has a similar piece of white
plastic caught in the fence and extending into the enclosure. An enclosure with 10 dogs has many smaller pieces of white
and blue plastic caught against the inside of the fence. Another enclosure with 11 dogs has many small pieces of this

plastic on the ground.

Areas where trash, junk, and discarded waste materials are allowed to accumulate can serve as breeding and living areas
for rodents and other pests. Discarded pieces of plastic bags can be ingested by dogs and cause intestinal problems and

dangerous obstructions.

Inspection Report

Premises where housing facilities are located, including enclosures and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in
good repair to protect the animals from injury, and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and other
pests and vermin. The licensee must remove all the trash, organic material, and discarded items from the dog
enclosures. The licensee must ensure that the premises of housing facilities are free of trash, discarded materials, and
waste products at all times.

3.11(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

A concrete ledge runs along the back wall of the covered outdoor enclosures and this ledge has a large amount of rodent
feces on its surface. Approximately 20 dogs are housed in these enclosures. The licensee stated that he has filled in a
few rat holes located near these dog enclosures and the inspectors observed a dead rat on the outside of the sheltered
housing building. Rodent control methods are being used inside the sheltered building but there are no rodent control
methods in place for the covered outdoor enclosures that surround the exterior of the sheltered building. Failure to have
an effective pest control program could increase the risk of disease hazards towards the dogs should they come into
contact with rodents and/or rodent droppings, as well as increase the potential for any dog food that is present to become

contaminated.

An effective program for the control of insects, external parasites, and birds and mammals that are pests must be
established and maintained. The licensee must establish an effective program to control the rodents located in the
covered outdoor enclosure areas. The licensee must ensure that all pest control programs are effective at all times.

Veterinary care for dogs.

Female Samoyed (ear tattoo #2) has poor dental health. Nearly the entire surface of the upper right and left cheek teeth
are covered in a thick brown tartar. The gums are moderately reddened and have receded away from the teeth. There is
a line of gray colored material located along the gum line of the upper right cheek teeth. The licensee stated that he knew
the dog’s teeth were poor and planned to have them cleaned by the attending veterinarian in the near future, but the
condition of the dog’s teeth, as well as the date the condition was identified and the treatment plan are not documented
and no medical record exists. Documenting veterinary care concerns assists in confirming that problems have been
identified and treatment has been sought in a timely manner, as well as establishes a documented medical history for the

animal.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records which include the date and description of the problem (such as disease,
illness, or injury), examination findings, test results, plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed.
The licensee must create a medical record for Samoyed #2 which includes a description of the animal’s problem, the date
the problem was identified and the plan to treat the problem. The licensee must ensure that all veterinary care concerns
are documented and maintained in a medical record and available for APHIS inspection.

To be corrected by: The licensee was instructed at the time of the inspection (April 7, 2021) and during the exit interview

that all veterinary care concerns must be fully documented.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.

2.40(b)(2)
Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).

The Canine Distemper-Adenovirus Type 2-Parainfluenza-Parvovirus vaccine used for the dogs is not stored at the correct
temperature. The temperature of the vaccine storage area is 60 degrees F and according to the vaccine label, the
vaccines should be stored at temperatures ranging between 35.6 degrees F and 44.6 degrees F. The vaccines have
been stored at the incorrect temperature since the previous evening and the inspection occurred at approximately

3:30pm. Improperly stored vaccines may lose their effectiveness which could cause the health of the animals to suffer.

The facility must use proper methods to prevent and control diseases. The licensee must store the vaccines at an
appropriate temperature to support the health and well-being of the dogs.
2.50(a)(1)

Time and method of identification.

Twelve adult dogs have no official form of identification. Identification is necessary to properly complete any required

documents and for APHIS officials to identify dogs and trace dogs back to their origins.

All live dogs on the premises, purchased, or otherwise acquired, sold or otherwise disposed of shall be identified by an

official tag affixed to the dog's neck by means of a collar, or shall be identified by a distinctive and legible tattoo marking

approved by the Administration, or by microchip. The licensee must add identification to these 12 dogs and must ensure
that all dogs on the premises have proper identification at all times.
3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.

One open bag of wood shavings used for bedding material and one open bucket of dog food are located inside the
whelping building. Open supplies of bedding and food may spoil or become contaminated by pests which could have a

negative impact on the health and well-being of the dogs.

Open supplies of food and bedding must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitted lids. The licensee must place
the open bag of wood shavings and open bucket of food into leakproof containers with tightly fitted lids. The licensee
must ensure that all bedding and food are properly stored at all times.

3.4(b)

Outdoor housing facilities.

One outdoor enclosure, containing three dogs, does not have a shelter large enough to accommodate all three dogs
compliantly. Shelters that are not large enough may result in the inability of a dog to escape adverse weather or extreme

temperatures which may have a negative impact on the animal's health and well-being.

Outdoor facilities for dogs must include one or more shelter structures that are large enough to allow each animal in the
shelter to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and turn about freely. The licensee must either add another shelter to the
enclosure or alter the current shelter in a manner that allows it to provide the required amount of space for each dog. The

licensee must ensure that each outdoor enclosure contains appropriate shelter space at all times.

Watering

A litter of 7 weaned puppies has spilled their bowl of water and no potable water is accessible to them at the time of the
inspection. Failure to provide potable water at all times does not ensure the puppies will remain properly hydrated which

could have a negative impact on their health and well-being.

Potable water must be continuously available to the dogs. The licensee must add potable water to the puppies enclosure
and ensure that all dogs have access to potable water at all times.
3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.

The written Program of Veterinary Care does not contain the dosages for the lvermectin pour-on which is used for the
treatment of ecotoparasites and blood parasites, as well as the dosages for Safeguard and Pyrantel which is used for the
treatment for intestinal parasites. The facility representatives were not exactly sure what the dosage for each product is
supposed to be. Failure to document the dosages does not ensure that the dogs are getting the appropriate amount of

each product which could cause their health and well-being to suffer.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is documented in writing, signed by the
attending veterinarian, and includes the treatment of parasites and other pests. The licensee must acquire the dosages
for each product and have them documented on the written Program of Veterinary Care. The licensee must ensure that

all treatment plans are documented in writing as part of the Program of Veterinary Care.

2.1(b)(1)
Requirements and application

The licensee has been conducting regulated activity out of sites that have not been approved. The licensee had been
informed multiple times in the past that these sites needed to be approved prior to conducting regulated activity from
them.

Conducting regulated activity from unapproved locations does not ensure the welfare of the animals which could result in
non-compliant living conditions and inadequate veterinary care.

A licensee shall notify Animal Care no fewer than 90 days and obtain a new license before any change name, address,
control or ownership of the business or operation, locations, activities, and number or types of animals. The licensee
must notify Animal Care of any new locations where he houses dogs used for regulated purposes in order to ensure the
Animal Welfare Act can be properly enforced.

To be corrected by: From this day forward the licensee must provide the locations of all facilities housing dogs used for
regulated purposes.

2.126(a) Critical

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.

location. The inspector called the licensee to request permission for the facility representative to conduct the inspection.
The licensee refused to allow APHIS officials to inspect the facility and the dogs. The inspector explained to the licensee
that he would be cited for refusing the inspection if he did not allow an inspection to take place. The licensee still refused
the inspection of the unlicensed site.

Refusing to allow inspections of regulated animals does not permit APHIS officials to enforce the Animal Welfare Act and
to confirm the living conditions, veterinary care and the overall welfare of the dogs.

Each dealer shall, during business hours, allow APHIS officials to inspect the facilities, property, records and animals.
The licensee must allow APHIS officials to inspect all facilities and animals used for regulated purposes in order to
confirm compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and to ensure the health and well-being of the dogs.

To be corrected by: The licensee must provide access to all facilities and animals for inspection from this day forward.

This inspection was a site approval inspection.

This site is not ready for approval to conduct activity covered under your current Animal Welfare Act License.

Conducting regulated activities at a non-approved site is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act.

Please contact your inspector to schedule your next new site approval inspection.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).

Female Shih tzu (tag #479) is showing signs of severe heat stress including open mouth breathing, high rate of
respiration, the tongue extending from the mouth beyond the teeth, and reddened skin. The dog was making a loud raspy
noise when she breathed and appeared to be gasping for breath. The dog is also expressing other behaviors indicating
she may be suffering from the ambient temperature such as laying sprawled across the floor and weak, unstable and
uncoordinated movements especially in her hind end. The dog was located in an outdoor shelter and had difficulty exiting
the shelter ultimately dragging her hind legs over the lip of the shelter entrance. Temperatures taken inside the shelter
ranged from 91 degrees F to 93 degrees F with a heat index of 107 degrees F to 109 degrees F. The facility
representative stated the dog had housed inside the sheltered building and moved to the outdoor enclosure that morning
and the dog had not been unstable or had difficulty with her hind legs before. The facility representative was not aware of

the dog's condition until the dog was found by the inspectors.

Heat stress could be detrimental to the health of the dog and can even result in death.

Female Cavalier spaniel (#492) has a large raw lesion on the inside of the right hind leg. The area is devoid of hair, is

leg with some hair loss and slight reddening of the skin. The hair around the affected areas is heavily matted, wet, tight to
the skin and has thick dark colored material trapped in it. Heavily matted hair is also located along the length of the
underside of the tail and has fresh and dried fecal material coating it. A greenish colored discharge is located on the
lower eyelids. Both wet and dry discharge is attached to the hair of the lower eyelids and a small amount is attached to
the interior section of the upper eyelids. Some straw was observed to be stuck in the discharge beneath the right eye.
The dog also has long rope-like mats attached to both ears and the mats are solid and coated with a dried grey material.

The facility representative was not aware of this dog's condition.

Abnormal skin and eye conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Matted hair could also cause discomfort

and pain and could also lead to further health issues.

Female Cocker Spaniel (tag #309) has poor ear health and a matted hair coat. The inside of the left ear is moderately
reddened, inflammed, and wet with a yellow liquid coating some of the ear's surfaces and attached from one surface to
another. The hair around the underside of the ear is wet with a dark brown material coating it. Long ropes of matted hair
are attached to the top of the dog's head and in front of the dog's left eye. The licensee was not aware of this dog's

condition.

Poor ear health could be painful to the dog and matted hair could also cause discomfort and pain to the animal as well as

lead to further health issues.

hole in the dog's back surrounded by heavily matted hair. The dog appeared sensitive and began to struggle only when
the affected areas were gently inspected. Excessively matted hair is located along the backside of both hindlegs and tail.
The hair is matted into large clumps. A large engorged tick is located on the dog's left ear and a small tick was located on
the right side of the muzzle. The facility representative did not know what the treatment plan is for ticks and was not

aware of the dog's condition.

Abnormal skin conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Matted hair could also cause discomfort and pain

and could also lead to further health issues. Ticks can transmit disease that can be detrimental to the health of the dog.

Female Cavalier spaniel (tag #444) has an abnormal condition of the skin and eyes. On both sides of the dog along the
top of the rib cage and back towards the hips are large hairless lesions. The lesions appear dark red in the center and
lighter red around their edges. A small amount of dark brown scab-like material is located on the surface of the lesions.
A hairless lesion is also on the surface of the right ear. The lesion is dark red in the center and lighter red along the
edges. A section of dark brown scab-like material is located in the center of the lesion. Another lesion was found on top
of the dog's head. The lesion is hairless, slightly reddened with scab-like material on the surface. Hair was seen in the
dog's mouth attached to the upper right cheek teeth along the gum line. When the hair was removed it revealed fresh
blood along the gum line. A greyish-white discharge is located on the lower eyelid of the left eye. Heavily matted hair is
located on the backside of the dog's hindlegs and contains a large clump of dark brown fecal material. The facility

representative is not aware of the condition of the dog.

Abnormal skin and eye conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Matted hair could also cause discomfort

and pain and could also lead to further health issues.

Inspection Report

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The above
mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective
treatment plan. The licensee must provide adequate veterinary care to the dogs at all times. The facility representative

had the dogs transported to a veterinarian at the time of the inspection.

Female Shiba Inu (tag #360) has excessively long toenails on all four feet. The toenails splayed out sideways when the
dog was standing on the flooring of the enclosure. The licensee and facility representative were unaware of the last time
the dog had her nails trimmed and were not aware that the toenails were overgrown. Excessively long toenails could

cause pain and discomfort as well as affect the dog's natural gait.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This dog must
have her toenails trimmed to an appropriate length and the licensee must ensure the plan to maintain properly trimmed

toenails is effective.

On June 2, 2021 the licensee had a prescription of Cephalexin and Rimadyl filled by the attending veterinarian for a dog
named "Misty". Instructions for the Cephalexin were to give 1 pill twice daily for 14 days with 28 pills prescribed. On the
day of the inspection, 23 Cephalexin pills were still remaining in the bottle. Instruction for the Rimadyl were to give 1 pill
twice daily for 14 days with 14 pills prescribed. On the day of the inspection, 14 pills Rimadyl! pills were still remaining in
the bottle. Failure to follow treatment plans and give medications as prescribed could interfere with the dog's ability to

recover from medical concerns and could lead to further health complications.

Five adult large breed dogs do not have an official form of identification. The facility representative stated that he has the
metal tags and collars for the dogs, but has not yet placed them around the dogs' necks. The facility representative also
stated that the dogs have an ear tattoo, but when the inspectors looked at the tattoo it had faded and was no longer
legible. Failure to have official identification applied to each dog does not allow the inspectors to identify the dog and

could interfere in the ability to connect medical records and other documentation to the dog.

A class "A" dealer can identify all live dogs using the following methods: An official tag affixed to a collar around the dog's
neck, a microchip, or by a legible tattoo marking approved by the Administrator. The licensee must place collars with the

official metal tags around the necks of the five dogs and ensure that all dogs have proper identification at all times.

Time and method of identification.

Cage cards are used as identification for every puppy. Throughout the facility numerous litters of weaned puppies are co-

mingled and in numerous unweaned litters contained foster puppies whith no relation to the female raising them.

One female Pomsky has a litter containing six puppies from three different dams. The DOB on the cage card is for her
puppy, but no DOB is documented on the cage card for the other puppies though it was thought by the facility
representative that the dates of birth for all the puppies were within 2 days of each other. There is also no identification
information for the female Pomsky on the cage card and no identifying information of the original dams and which puppy

belongs to which dam.

Inspection Report

The information provided by the cage cards did not allow the inspectors to determine which puppies belonged to the adult
female residing in the enclosure and which additional adult females were dams tothe other puppies. An incomplete cage

card does not meet the requirements for identification.

A class "A" dealer must identify all dogs under 16 weeks old by the use of an official tag, a distinctive and legible tattoo, or
a plastic-type collar containing the required information. APHIS Officials also accept microchips or written identification
attached to the enclosure (cage cards) for puppies under 16 weeks old provided that these puppies are maintained in
distinct litters and provided that the cage card contains all of the required information. The consistent movement of
puppies from one mother to another does not constitute maintenance of puppies in distinct litters and failure to individually

identify puppies prevents APHIS Officials from tracking animals movement either in the facility or following sale.

The licensee must ensure that each animal's identity is known with certainty by appropriate individual identification or by
maintaining puppies less than 16 weeks old in distinct groups that are not co-mingled and using appropriate cage cards

with all required information.

The Program of Veterinary Care could not be located for review by the inspectors. During the inspection, one dog was
identified which had ticks attached to her ear and face. The facility representative did not know the plan for treating or
preventing ticks and the plan could not be reviewed due to the missing Program of Veterinary Care. Multiple dogs were
identified with heavily matted hair coats and one dog was identified with severely overgrown toenails, but the plans to
maintain healthy and unmatted hair coats and properly trimmed toenails are located in the Program of Veterinary Care, so
could not be reviewed. Failure to provide the Program of Veterinary Care to the inspectors for review does not ensure the

dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care which could have a negative impact on their health and well-being.

The Exercise Plan for Dogs could not be located for review by the inspectors. Failure to provide the written exercise plan

Handling of animals.

Female Shih tzu (tag #479) is showing signs of severe heat distress. The dog was found inside a shelter located in an
outdoor enclosure. The inspector could hear a rasping sound coming from the shelter as she approached it. Upon
opening the shelter door the inspector observed the dog lying on the floor of the shelter creating a loud raspy sound as
she appeared to gasp for breath. The dog is performing wide open mouth breathing with an extremely high respiration
rate and her tongue is extending out of her mouth beyond the teeth. The dog had recently been shaved and her skin
appeared to have a reddened tint. The dog moved about the shelter, but appeared unstable and continuously laid
sprawled on the floor with her legs stretched out. To exit the shelter, the dog is required to step over a lip at the shelter
entrance and the inspectors observed her having difficulty getting over the lip and finally succeeded in exiting the shelter
by dragging her hind legs across it. The dog continued to appear unstable and had difficulty keeping her hind legs from

collapsing. The facility representative stated the dog had never had problems with her hind legs.

The dog was moved to an enclosure inside the Whelping Building next to an open door with a breeze. The dog still
appeared unstable and had some difficulty moving around the enclosure and needed slight assistance from the facility
representative to locate the water receptacle, whereupon, she immediately began to drink. The dog drank water multiple
times as the inspectors watched. The dog continued to have an extremely high respiration rate along with open mouth

breathing and lying sprawled on the enclosure floor.

Inspection Report

The inspectors observed the dog again approximately an hour after she had been moved to the Whelping Building, and

she still appeared slightly weak and unstable.

The facility representative stated that the dog is normally housed inside the sheltered housing building, but had been
moved to the outdoor enclosure that morning. The temperature directly inside the shelter door was between 91 degrees

F and 93 degrees F with a heat index between 107 degrees F and 109 degrees F according to the inspector's Kestrel.

Housing dogs in temperatures and humidity that are inappropriate could result in the discomfort, suffering, and even

death.

When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to
alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity,
and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal's age,
species, breed, overall health status, and acclimation. The licensee must ensure that all dogs are housed in climatic

conditions that are appropriate to maintain their comfort and well-being at all times.

To be corrected by: At the time of the inspection the facility representative moved the dog to a more appropriate location
and then transported her to a veterinarian.

facility representative explained that the dog, a mini Australian Shepherd, had crawled under the fence through one of the
gaps between two adjacent enclosures, and when it entered the adjacent enclosure, it was attacked and killed by the

dogs housed there.

Within the sheltered housing building there is one enclosure, containing an adult female dog and her seven puppies, that
has an opening cut in the fencing that will accommodate a self-feeder. The opening is located along the floor and did not
contain a self-feeder at the time of the inspection. The opening is large enough to allow a puppy to escape from the

enclosure.

A section of the metal fencing between two enclosures, containing a total of two adult dogs and three puppies, in the
covered outdoor enclosures is not secured and is easily moved. One of the adjacent gates is secured with wire, but the

resulting gap is large enough that the dogs could put their head or leg through.

Thirteen enclosures in the whelping building, housing approximately 8 adult female dogs and 97 puppies, have carabiner

style clips to secure entrance to the enclosure. These clips do not secure the entrance tightly and leave a gap large

enough for the puppies to put their heads and legs through.

Carpet squares used as bedding in three enclosures containing 3 adult dogs and approximately 15 unweaned puppies,

have long strands of the material that have pulled away and pose a choking threat to puppies.

during an earlier visit to the facility, but the facility representative stated he had not had time to fix the water pipe.

Facilities that are not structurally sound, in good repair, or properly maintained pose a risk to the animals they are to
house and protect. When the enclosure fails to contain the animals, this can result in injury, inability to access food and

water, and in the case described above, death.

Facilities, enclosures, and their contents must be good repair. Housing facilities for dogs must protect the animals from
injuries and contain the animals securely. The licensee must alter the enclosures in a manner that removes the openings
and gaps and eliminates the ability of the animals to escape. The licensee must also repair the leaking water pipe.

The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the animals and contain them securely at all times.

There is an approximately 3’ x 6’ closet located in the sheltered building were the dams and unweaned puppies are
housed. The closet is full of a variety of whelping beds, boxes, bags, buckets, pales, screens, and other unused items to
the point you cannot enter the closet much further than the doorway. The closet also has a leaking water pipe near the

door with large pile of soaked wood shaving bedding material that has been put down to absorb some of the water.

Housing areas must be free of areas that are cluttered or inaccessible and where pests and other vermin could take up
residence. Inaccessible areas cannot be cleaned or evaluated for structural problems. This is particularly troublesome
when there is a visible problem like a water leak that could be causing further problems in adjacent areas that cannot be

evaluated due to the clutter.

The drains for the sheltered housing building and the covered outdoor runs transports waste directly outside the building's
exterior walls. The drain on the northwest corner has created a large, thick pile of wet fecal and food waste, hair, and
straw. The wet pile has built-up against the lower portion of the exterior wall and has attracted a large number of flies.

APHIS officials had identified the problem on an earlier visit, but the facility has not taken any corrective measures.

The drain on the southwest corner of the sheltered building dumps into PVC pipes that lay on top of the ground and
transports the waste down a hill and away from the building. The PVC pipes run parallel to one outdoor enclosure that
contains eight adult dogs. A stream of liquid waste containing material that is dark green and black is flowing through a
section of the outdoor enclosure. Wet, mossy material is located between the drain pipe and the fence of the enclosure.

The drain pipe could not be checked for damage as the vegetation is overgrown and has hidden most of the pipe.

Drains and drainage areas that are not properly maintained could result in a buildup of waste that could attract pests,

create odors, soil animals, and increase the risk of disease hazards.

Disposal and drainage systems must minimize vermin and pest infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. All
drains must be properly constructed, installed, and maintained. The licensee must alter the drains in a manner that
moves the pile of waste away from the exterior of the building and eliminates the stream of waste flowing through the dog

enclosure. The licensee must ensure that all drains are working properly at all times.

During the inspection, the inspectors identified a decomposing dog that had been killed in a fight. The dog's body was
placed outside of the enclosure, but just a few feet away from the fence. Decomposing animals could attract pests such

as flies, create odors and increase the risk of disease.

Housing facility operators must provide for regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food
wastes, bedding, debris, garbage, water, other fluids and wastes, and dead animals, in a manner that minimizes
contamination and disease risks. The licensee must remove the dead dog and ensure that all waste, including dead

animals, are removed from the areas housing dogs as quickly as possible.

In the Whelping Building the trash can is missing the lid and a large pile of empty sacks is placed in a corner. Exposed

trash could attract pests such as flies and mice which could have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.

Trash containers in housing facilities and in food storage and food preparation areas must be leakproof and must have
tightly fitted lids on them at all times. The facility representative replaced the lid to the trash can at the time of the
inspection, but the license must ensure that all trash is collected as quickly as possible and placed in leak -proof

containers bearing tightly fitted lids.

licensee must ensure that all shelters are compliant at all times.
3.4(c)

Outdoor housing facilities.

The framing on the largest shelter in the outdoor enclosure containing 8 Golden Retrievers is made of wood. According to

the facility representative, the wood is not water resistant or sealed against moisture.

A 12 to 16 foot long, approximately 10 inch wide board has been attached to the bottom of the wire fence to build a barrier
between two outdoor enclosures. The board was placed there to prevent the dogs from digging more holes under the
fence and entering the adjacent enclosure through those holes. Approximately 10 dogs have direct contact with the board

and the facility representative says the board is not water resistant or sealed against moisture.

One outdoor enclosure, containing approximately 12 dogs, has a metal access door inserted into painted plywood at the
entrance tothe shelter. The plywood has been chewed and damaged resulting in a hole in the plywood and unsealed

wood around the access door.

Surfaces of enclosures that have potential contact with dogs must be cleanable and sanitizable in order to prevent the
buildup of debris and other materials that can harbor contaminated and potentially disease-causing agents. These
surfaces must be impervious to water to allow repeated and ongoing cleaning without the deterioration of the surface.
The licensee must ensure that building surfaces in contact with animals in outdoor facilities are impervious to moisture.

Surfaces made of wood that is not pretreated to be impervious to moisture must be sealed.

3.6(a)(2)(x)
Primary enclosures.

The whelping building has 57 enclosures that each include a whelping box in the back half of the enclosure and slatted
flooring enclosed by wire fencing in the front half. The floor slats are approximately 3 to 4 inches wide, but the gaps
between them are wide enough that the legs of puppies will easily and frequently fall through them. The inspectors
observed puppies in numerous enclosures and witnessed the legs of one or more of the puppies fall through the

openings.

During the inspection an adult Shih tzu was moved into the building and the inspectors observed her legs fall through the

gaps in the flooring.

APHIS officials had identified this issue to the licensee and facility representative at earlier visits to the facility, but no

action has been taken to correct the problem.

To prevent injuries to legs and feet, puppies need a safe stable surface to move and learn to walk on. To protect them

from injury, all dogs require a safe floor surfaces that will not allow their legs to pass through.

Primary enclosures must have floors constructed in a manner that does not allow the dogs' feet to pass through any
openings in the floor. The licensee must alter the floors in a manner that will not allow the feet of the dogs to pass

through. The licensee must ensure that all flooring is safe for the dogs at all times.

Primary enclosures.

In the sheltered building, one enclosure contains 3 adult dogs and a 10-week-old puppy.
Young puppies under 16 weeks old are not well socialized or accustomed to the dynamics of competing for food or water

with other dogs and my not be able to fend for themselves against aggressive or dominant adult dogs.

Puppies under 16 weeks (4 months) of age may not be housed in the same primary enclosure with adult dogs, other than
the dam or foster. The licensee must house the puppy in a separate enclosure from the adults. The licensee must

ensure that all dogs housed together are compatible at all times.

Feeding

Metal self-feeders are provided tothe dogs housed in the covered outdoor enclosures. In at least two enclosures,
containing a total of five adult dogs, the dog food in the feeders has become coated in a greenish-white substance that
appears to be mold. The moldy food is located underneath the fresh food and is caked together. Food contaminated by

mold could have a negative impact on the health of the dogs should they consume it.

Measures must be taken to ensure that there is no molding, deterioration, and caking of feed. The licensee must remove

the moldy food from the metal feeders and ensure that all food provided to the dogs is free of mold and other

Watering

An enclosure in the sheltered housing building containing an adult female Shar-pei and 7 unweaned puppies has an
empty water bowl and no other source of potable water. The facility representative explained that the bowl had been filled

earlier this morning and must have been spilled.

One enclosure in the large Whelping Building, containing one adult dog and six puppies, has an empty water bowl and no

additional source of potable water.

An outdoor enclosure containing approximately ten adult dogs has one water bowl that is nearly empty and the remaining

water is a mud brown color with a buildup up of brown sediment and debris inside it from the dogs entering the bowl water

with their dirty paws. One dog was observed sitting in the water bowl. The outdoor temperature was in the low 90s.

For their overall health and wellbeing, dogs need to have potable water available at all times. This is even more important

during times of extreme heat and requires frequent monitoring by facility staff.

The licensee must ensure that potable water is continuously available to all dogs.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

Approximately seven feeders, located in various enclosures through the facility and affecting approximately 20 dogs, have
a brownish buildup of material on the bottom-front edge of the feeder that looks like a combination of powered feed and

dirt.

In the whelping building, two enclosures with 2 dams and approximately 12 unweaned puppies, have a dry brownish
material smeared on some of the vertical surfaces of the whelping boxes which appears to be caused by the dogs
jumping up and putting dirty, feces covered paws against the walls. One enclosure had a similar brownish crusty material

on the livestock panel across the front of the enclosure and hair was trapped in the crusty material.

Two of the outdoor enclosures, containing approximately 15 dogs, have shelters that contained dried and fresh fecal

material on the floors and a dry brownish material smeared on the some of the vertical surfaces of walls.

The buildup of dirt and fecal contaminated material in enclosures and shelters exposes dogs to bacteria and contaminants

that are disease hazards. This is particularly hazardous when the soiled surfaces are in food and water receptacles.

Primary enclosures, including the shelters within them, and food and water receptacles, must be sanitized at least once
every two weeks and more often if necessary, to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, fecal material, or

other disease hazards. The licensee must sanitize all the affected surfaces and ensure all surfaces remain free of a

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

At least four outdoor shelters, accessed by a total of approximately 32 dogs, contain straw bedding material. The majority
of the straw bedding is dark in color and compacted together in a solid pile and the inspector had to pull the layers of
straw apart. The layers of straw were wet, dirty, moldy and had a strong odor of mold. In one of the shelters, accessed
by eight dogs, the contaminated straw was peeled up to reveal a colony of ant-like insects beneath it and in another
affected shelter, accessed by nine dogs, flying gnat-like insects came out of the contaminated straw. The facility

representative was unaware of the contaminated condition of the straw bedding.

In the large Whelping building, the whelping boxes contain wood shavings as absorbent material. In two whelping boxes,
accessed by a total of fifteen puppies, the shavings were completely saturated with urine and feces with no clean,
absorbent areas left. The puppies were observed running around in the wet, dirty shavings. The facility representative

stated that the shavings are only cleaned out of the boxes and replaced once a day.

Bedding material contaminated by waste, mold, dirt and insects may cause the animals to become wet and soiled as well

as raise the risk of disease hazards.

Pens, runs, and outdoor housing areas using material that cannot be sanitized using the methods provided in the

regulations, such as gravel, sand, grass, earth, or absorbent bedding, must be sanitized by removing the contaminated

There is a buildup of dirt, dust and cobwebs along the back wall of the covered outdoor enclosures and on the retaining
walls and ledges of the exterior wall. The buildup of dust, dirt and cobwebs can increase the risk of disease hazards

towards the dogs.

Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds must be kept clean. The
licensee must remove the buildup of dirt, dust, and cobwebs from the walls and ledges of the covered outdoor enclosures

and ensure the building and surrounding areas remain clean.

The vegetation around the sheltered building is excessively overgrown. The vegetation is growing up against the exterior
walls and it is interfering in the ability of waste to flow from the drains and away from the building. The vegetation is also
covering the building's drainage pipe which lies on top of the ground and it cannot be determined if the pipe is damaged
and leaking as the pipe cannot be visualized. Overgrown vegetation can attract pests such as flies and mice, as well as

make it difficult to view areas of the facility for damage and interfere with cleaning processes.

An excessively large number of flies and insects are located throughout the facility. The interiors of the sheltered building
and whelping building, containing approximately 71 adult dogs and 370 puppies, are kept cool by leaving the doors open.
The doors have no screens and flies and other insects are free to enter the buildings. Flies were seen on the walls of the
buildings and enclosures, in the water bowls, in the food bowls and on the dog food, on the floors of the enclosures, and
on the dogs themselves. In the outdoor enclosures flies were inside some of the shelters, accessed by a total of 17 dogs,
along with gnat-like insects and ant-like insects that had infested the straw bedding. The facility representative stated
that they spray for flies inside the buildings. Excessive numbers of flies and other insects can contaminate food and water

as well as cause health hazards towards the dogs.

An effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs and cats, and birds and mammals that
are pests, must be established and maintained. The licensee must establish an effective plan to control flies and other
insects in order to support the health of the dogs. The licensee must ensure the plan is effective at all times.

information concerning the identity of the animal on medical records does not allow APHIS officials to determine which
dog the medical record belongs to and interferes in the inspector's ability to determine if the animal has received adequate

veterinary care.

Each dealer shall make and keep medical records for dogs that include the identity of the animal, including identifying
marks, tattoos, or tags on the animal and the animal’s breed, sex, and age. The licensee must ensure that all medical
records contain the identification of the dog in order to allow APHIS officials to determine if a specific dog has received

During a prior visit conducted by APHIS officials, nine dogs were identified that required veterinary care. At the time of
the current inspection, the inspectors requested the written medical records for these dogs, but the facility has no written
medical records concerning the examination, diagnosis and treatment plans for these animals. Failure to maintain

medical records does not allow APHIS officials to ensure the animals have received adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer shall maintain medical records that include the problem identified, the date and description of the problem,
examination findings, test results, plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed. The licensee must
document in writing all required information for any dog with a medical concern in order for the inspectors to determine the

animal has received adequate veterinary care.

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.

The facility has five adult dogs contained in three transport enclosures waiting to be taken to another location. There is no
absorbent litter in any of the three transport enclosures and feces and spilled dog food are located on the floor of one of
these enclosures. The inspectors first observed these dogs at approximately 9am and the facility representative stated
the dogs had been in the transport enclosures since 7am. The inspectors left the facility at approximately 3pm and two
dogs still remained in transport enclosures with no absorbent litterand feces and spilled dog food are located on the floor
of one of the enclosures. Failure to provide clean, absorbent litter may cause the dogs to become contaminated by waste

material.

Primary enclosures used to transport dogs must contain enough unused litter to absorb and cover excreta. The litter must
be of a suitably absorbent material that is safe and nontoxic to the dogs. The licensee must add absorbent litter to all

enclosures used to transport dogs in order to ensure the dogs remain clean and dry.

inspectors observed one dog turning around in an abnormal position due to the lack of space. The dog was required to
lower his hind end towards the floor in order to bend his front end around to complete the turn in the tight quarters.

Failure to provide adequate space during transport may have a negative impact on the animal's health and well-being.

Terminal facilities.

Five dogs are contained in transport enclosures waiting to be moved to another location. The enclosures are sitting in
front of the kennel along the driveway and are provided with no shade to protect them from direct sunlight. Two of the
transport enclosures are constructed of plastic with a solid top, but one of the transport enclosures is a wire crate with no
solid top. The inspectors requested the facility representative to provide the dogs with shade which was done. Failure to
provide protection from the direct rays of the sun could cause the dogs to become overheated which could have a

detrimental impact on their health and well-being.

Shade must be provided that is sufficient to protect the dog from the direct rays of the sun. The licensee must ensure that

all dogs housed in transport enclosures have sufficient shade as protection from the direct rays of the sun in order to

support their health and well-being.

To be corrected by: The facility representative provided shade to the dogs at the time of the inspection.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealersand exhibitors).

Female Boston terrier (#2) has an abnormal condition to the left eye. The dog is squinting the eye and appears unable to
fully open the eye. The upper and lower eyelids are swollen and large amount of greyish colored discharge is coming
from the eye and coating the hair beneath it. Some thick pieces of dried discharge are sticking to the hair above and
below the eye. The eye appears to be a blueish color and the white of the eye is severely reddened. Beneath the left eye

is an area containing hairless reddened lesions. The dog has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian.

Poor eye health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog.

Female Wheaton (#139) has an abnormal condition of the left front leg. The leg is extremely swollen from the elbow to
the foot. The animal appeared hesitant to bear weight on the leg and moved about with a pronounced limp. Many times
the inspectors observed the dog failing to bear weight on the leg while moving. A laceration was located on the outside of
the leg beneath the elbow. The skin around the laceration is slightly reddened and the hair in this affected area is wet. A

light grey colored substance is located in the laceration. The dog has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian.

Swollen areas, failure to bear weight, and lameness could indicate a serious underlying health issue.

7005 is accurate and contains the required information at all times.
3.1(c)(1)(ii)

Housing facilities, general.

In Building #6, there are at least four enclosures, housing an approximate total of seven dogs, that have sharp points
located at the level of dogs. The sharp points are created by metal fence rods that have been cut in order to slide a food

bowl inside the dog enclosure. Sharp points could cause injury to the dogs.

Housing facilities must be free of jagged edges or sharp points that might injure the animals. The licensee must alter
these sharp points in a manner that eliminates the risk of injury to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures
are safe for the dogs at all times.

3.1(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.

One enclosure, containing two Golden retrievers, has an excessively damaged plastic water bucket. The dogs have
excessively chewed the top edge of the bucket and hair is trapped in the affected area of the bucket. Damaged surfaces

can not be properly cleaned and sanitized which could result in the increased risk of disease.

All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities - including all objects within the facility -
that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must replace the water
bucket or alter the damaged areas in a manner that allows for cleaning and sanitizing of the bucket. The licensee must

ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities are maintained at all times.

Inspection Report

Housing facilities, general.

The unopened bags of dog food are stored in the shop on a wooden pallet directly beneath a vehicle with an exposed
engine. Oil from the engine is dripping on top of the plastic sheeting covering the dog food. Contamination of the food by

engine oil could be detrimental to the health of the animals should they consume the food.

Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and
vermin infestation. The licensee must store the unopened bags of dog food in a location where there is no risk of
contamination. The licensee must ensure that all food is properly stored at all times.

3.1(f)

Housing facilities, general.

In Building 5, the trash can does not have a lid. Open trash cans could create odors and attract pests such as flies and

mice which could have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.

Trash containers in housing facilities and in food storage and food preparation areas must be leakproof and must have
tightly fitted lids on them at all times. The licensee must add a lid to the trash can and ensure that all trash containers
contain lids at all times.

3.2(d)

Indoor housing facilities.

In at least three enclosures, containing approximately a total of four dogs, small areas of the covering on the walls has
been torn exposing the wood beneath it. The wood is not impervious to moisture and is located at the level of the dogs.

Wood that is not impervious to moisture may begin to rot which could weaken the structural integrity of the enclosures.

The floors and walls of indoor housing facilities, and any other surfaces in contact with the animals, must be impervious to

licensee must ensure all surfaces of housing facilities are maintained at all times.
3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

In at least two enclosures, containing an approximate total of three bulldogs, there is a buildup of dark colored dirt and
grime on the walls located at the level of the dogs. The buildup of dirt and grime could increase the risk of disease

towards the dogs.

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks
and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
The licensee must sanitize the affected enclosure and ensure that all enclosures remain free of a buildup of dirt and grime
at all times.

3.13(a)(1)

Veterinary care for dogs.

The Program of Veterinary Care is incomplete. The frequency of regularly scheduled visits by the attending veterinarian
is missing. Regularly scheduled visits to the facility by the attending veterinarian are important to aid in identifying

animals with veterinary care concerns.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian and contains the frequency in which regular visits by the attending veterinarian are
scheduled. The licensee must add the frequency in which regularly scheduled visits will be conducted by the attending

veterinarian to the Program of Veterinary Care.

Veterinary care for dogs.

The Program of Veterinary Care in incomplete. The plans for preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy and
unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed toenails, and clean and healthy ears, eyes, skin and teeth are missing. These

plans are necessary to ensure that dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian that includes plans for maintaining the overall health of the dog. The licensee must
add the missing plans to the Program of Veterinary Care in order to support the health and well-being of the dogs.
3.13(b)(2)

Veterinary care for dogs.

Atleast nineteen dogs are receiving treatment by the facility for veterinary concerns. The medical records kept by the
facility are incomplete and are missing necessary information. None of the records contain the information on how many
times a day a treatment should be administered or how many days the treatment should be administered. The dosages
of medical products such as penicillin is also missing. A few records lack the name of the product used and simply say
"antibiotic spray" or "antibiotic". Failure to provide a complete written medical plan does not allow APHIS officials to

ensure that treatments plans are being followed and that medical materials are being administered properly.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. These

records must include the problem identified, the date and a description of the problem, examination findings, test results,

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealersand exhibitors).

The vaccines for the dogs are inappropriately stored. The temperature of the refrigerator containing the vaccines is 56
degrees F per the inspector's Kestrel. The licensee has only a small number of vaccines in the refrigerator, which are

required to be stored between 35-45 degrees F.

Failure to store vaccines at appropriate temperatures may interfere with their effectiveness resulting in an increased risk

of disease.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must store all vaccines at the required temperatures to ensure that all dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

The facility representative presented an itemized bill from the veterinary clinic containing the medical information for
Cavalier #492, Cavalier #444, Pekingese #460, and Shih tzu #479. The official identification number for each dog was not
listed on the medical records. In addition to these dogs, several other adult dogs and puppies are listed on the bill, but

their official identification is missing also. Failure to provide information concerning the identity of the animal on medical

inspector's ability to determine if the animal has received adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer shall make and keep medical records for dogs that include the identity of the animal, including identifying
marks, tattoos, or tags on the animal and the animal’s breed, sex, and age. The licensee must ensure that all medical
records contain the identification of the dog in order to allow APHIS officials to determine if a specific dog has received
adequate veterinary care.

3.13(b)(2) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.

At the previous inspection of the facility conducted by APHIS officials, five dogs were identified that required veterinary
care from a licensed veterinarian. The facility representative presented an itemized bill showing the medical treatments
for each dog. The itemized bill did not include the actual treatments applied to four of the five dogs. Instead the bill
stated:

Shih tzu - exam, overheated/not feeling well, indoor boarding

Pekingese - exam, matted/sore, indoor boarding

Cavalier 1 - exam, matted/sore, indoor boarding

Cavalier 2 - exam, matted/sore, indoor boarding

Failure to maintain medical records indicating the treatment received and/or a complete treatment plan does not allow

APHIS officials to ensure the animals have received adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer shall maintain medical records that include the problem identified, the date and description of the problem,

examination findings, test results, plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed. The licensee must

2.40(b)(2) Direct Repeat
Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).

Female Golden retriever (tag #142) has a severely emaciated body condition. The dog's hip bones, ribs, shoulder blades
and back bone are clearly visible and there is little to no fat or muscle covering the animal. The dog had arrived at the
facility in early April and was observed by the inspectors to be in poor body condition, but was under veterinary treatment.
APHIS officials had visited the facility again in late May and the dog's body condition had gotten worse and she had not
been re-evaluated by a veterinary at that time. Currently, the dog has not been re-evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for
her emaciated body condition. An emaciated body condition could indicate a serious underlying health issue, and if left

untreated, could result in the death of the animal.

Female brown Cocker spaniel (no ID) has an enlarged, swollen abdomen. The dog was observed walking around the
enclosure in a hunched position for approximately one minute. The dog appeared to be straining to defecate, and was
finally able to release some liquid feces. The licensee stated that he does not believe the dog is pregnant and she has
not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian. Swollen abdomens and trouble defecating could indicate a serious

underlying health issue.

Female Cavalier (tag #296) has an abnormal appearance to the left eye. A large amount of brownish colored discharge

was located around the upper and lower eye lid and going down the face from the corner of the eye. The white of the eye
is slightly reddened. A small red area is located on the surface of the cornea. The dog is not currently under any

veterinary treatment. Abnormal conditions of the eye could cause pain and discomfort to the dog.

Female Cavalier (#352) has an abnormal condition to both eyes. A large amount of greenish-yellow discharge is attached
to the hair around the upper and lower eyelids of both eyes. The inspector observed the discharge stuck to the surface of
both of the dog's eyes. The white of the right eye was slightly reddened. The licensee stated that the dog had been
under treatment for the eyes before, but was not currently under any treatment from a licensed veterinarian. Abnormal

conditions of the eye could cause pain and discomfort to the animal.

Male Bernese Mountain dog (no ID) has an abnormal condition to the left eye. A large amount of greyish colored

discharge is located along the bottom of the dog's eye. The dog is not under any treatment by a licensed veterinarian.

Female Bernese Mountain dog (no ID) has an abnormal condition to the top of her nose. The top of her nose is raw, dark
red and has areas covered by a scab-like material. The licensee had not noticed the condition of the dog and she was

under no veterinary treatment. Wounds to the nose could cause pain and discomfort to the animal.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must have the above mentioned dogs evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to establish an
effective treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

The licensee had the dogs evaluated by a veterinarian at the time of the inspection.

Inspection Report

Cocker spaniel (tag #386) has a heavily matted hair coat along the underside of neck and onto the chest. The mats have
formed into large, solid brownish colored balls of hair that are held tightly to the skin. Matted hair can cause pain and

discomfort as well as lead to further health issues.

The licensee must have the matted hair removed from the Cocker spaniels hair coat. The licensee must ensure that the
hair coats of all dogs remain free of matted hair at all times.
2.50(a)(1) Repeat

Time and method of identification.

One male Bernese Mountain dog, one female Bernese Mountain dog, and one female Cocker spaniel do not have an
official form of identification. Failure to have official identification applied to each dog does not allow the inspectors to

identify the dog and could interfere in the ability to connect medical records and other documentation to the dog.

A class "A" dealer can identify all live dogs using the following methods: An official tag affixed to a collar around the dog's
neck, a microchip, or by a legible tattoo marking approved by the Administrator. The licensee must provide each dog with
an official form of identification and ensure that all dogs have proper identification at all times.

2.126(a)(4) Direct

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.

The licensee has been housing dogs in two buildings on the property, but has failed to present the animals and their

enclosures for inspection. The licensee did not notify APHIS officials that he was housing dogs in these buildings during
previous inspections. Inspection of these two buildings found the sanitizing requirements, watering, veterinary care, pest
control and housekeeping of the buildings and enclosures to be noncompliant with the regulations of the Animal Welfare

Act. At least 17 adult dogs and 19 puppies are housed in one of the buildings and 9 adult dogs are housed in the other

building. Two dead dogs were found in one building and 1 emaciated Golden retriever was found in the other building.
Failure to allow APHIS officials to inspect all animals and their enclosures does not ensure the animals are kept and cared

for in conditions required by the Animal Welfare Act which could cause the welfare of the animals to suffer.

Each dealer, shall, during business hours, allow APHIS officials to inspect and photograph the facilities, property and
animals, as the APHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the provisions of the Act, the regulations and the standards.
The licensee must present all regulated animals and their housing for inspection by APHIS officials in order to ensure the

welfare of the animals.

To be corrected by: From this day forward the licensee must present all animals for inspection.

Handling of animals.

A heat advisory has been issued for the area and several adult dogs and puppies located throughout the facility were

showing signs of heat stress including:

Female poodle is contained in a transport crate at the time of the inspection. The dog is open mouth breathing, has a
high respiration rate, and the tongue is extended out of the mouth beyond the teeth. The dog began crying out while
being observed by the inspectors. The temperature taken by the inspectors Kestrel is 95 degrees F with a heat index of

119 degrees F.

according to the inspectors Kestrel is 92 degrees F with a heat index of 112 degrees F.

In the large Whelping building there are numerous puppies below the age of 8 weeks that have high respiration rates and
open mouth breathing with tongues extending out of the mouth and beyond the teeth. The temperature throughout the

building, according to the inspectors Kestrel, was 95 degrees F with a heat index of 117 degrees.

Heat stress could have a detrimental impact on the health and well-being of the animal and can even result in death.

When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to
alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity,
and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being. The licensee must alter the temperature to a level that is
comfortable for the dogs. The licensee must ensure the dogs are maintained in appropriate climatic conditions at all
times.

Housing facilities, general.
A loose Pomsky was noticed running around the outside of the covered outdoor enclosures. The Pomsky had direct

access to the road. The licensee stated that the employees were not able to catch it. During the inspection, a beagle was
observed by inspectors to jump on top of the shelter and then jump into other enclosures where it could potentially come
into contact with incompatible dogs. In the horse barn the dogs are housed in horse stalls. In at least on of these
enclosures there is a hole in the stall wall and a dog was observed to stick its head, neck and forefeet through the
opening and come into direct contact with the dogs in the next enclosure. In another enclosure in the horse barn, a horse

stall containing 10 puppies had a dug a hole beneath the stall wall and were observed going through the hole and

entering the next enclosure which contained trash and debris which could harm the puppies.

The previous inspection report contained a citation for a dog which had escaped its enclosure and was killed by other

dogs. Failure of the enclosure to contain the dogs could result in injury, escape and even the death of an animal.

Housing facilities for dogs and cats must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be
kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals
from entering.

3.1(b) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.

Seventeen dogs and 19 puppies are housed in a horse barn. Each enclosure contains numerous pieces of trash and
waste materials. The trash consists of hay netting, empty bags, wooden boards, metal horse shoes, and countless
pieces of shredded cloth. Areas of the alleyway of the barn is covered in loose hay along with unused wooden pallets and

empty bags.

Ten adult dogs are housed in another building which contains a large amount of clutter and waste material. Numerous
empty bags and pieces of plastic are located in the alleyway of the building and in unused enclosures. One unused
enclosure contains a large number of stored metal gates. A large pile of used wood shavings is sitting on the floor of the
alleyway in front of dog enclosures. The areas around these cluttered items are dirty with a buildup of hair, organic

material and used wood shavings. An excessively large number of flies are also located in the building.

Clutter and trash could increase odors as well as attract pests such as flies and mice which could increase the risk of

Housing facilities and areas used for storing animal food or bedding must be free of any accumulation of trash, waste
material, junk, weeds, and other discarded materials. Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free
of clutter, including equipment, furniture, and stored material, but may contain materials actually used and necessary for
cleaning the area, and fixtures or equipment necessary for proper husbandry practices and research needs. The licensee
must remove the trash, waste, and unused materials from the housing facilities in order to support the health and well-
being of the dogs.

3.1(f) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.

In the building housing 10 adult dogs there is an open sack of trash sitting on the floor. Open sacks of trash could create

odors and attract pests such as flies and mice.

Trash containers in housing facilities and in food storage and food preparation areas must be leakproof and must have
tightly fitted lids on them at all times. The licensee must place the trash sack in leak proof container with a tightly fitted lid.

Primary enclosures.

The facility has removed sections of the raised plastic flooring in the covered outdoor enclosures leaving a section of
concrete exposed. After the facility washes out the enclosure the concrete remains wet and any feces deposited on the
concrete becomes wet and runny. The hair coat of one female Golden retriever (tag #801) is excessively wet and
contaminated with feces. The hair coat covering both hind legs, the tail, and the abdomen are wet and the hair is coated

in feces and felt gritty to the inspectors touch. The licensee stated that this dog likes to lay on the wet concrete to cool

down. The inspector observed wet, runny feces on the concrete in numerous covered outdoor enclosures. A wet and

feces contaminated hair coat could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dog.

The primary enclosures must be designed to enable the dogs and cats to remain dry and clean. The licensee must alter

the enclosure in a manner that will keep the dog clean and dry in order to support its health and well-being.

3.10(a) Direct Repeat
Watering

Numerous dogs throughout the facility have no potable water. Approximately 2 adult dogs housed in the sheltered
housing building and 8 dogs housed in the horse barn had no water in their water receptacles. Approximately 22 dogs
housed in the outdoor enclosures had either a large amount of dirt in their water receptacle or the water receptacle had a
coating of green algae with small pieces of algae floating in the water. The dogs were observed standing and sitting in
their water receptacles along with digging the water out of the receptacles. The dogs were also observed drinking the
contaminated water. The temperatures taken throughout the facility ranged from 92 -97 degrees F with a heat index up to

119 degrees F.

Failure to provide potable water could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dogs.

Potable water must be continuously available to the dogs. The licensee must provide potable water to the dogs and

ensure they have access to potable water at all times.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest conirol.

Ten adult dogs are housed in a building across from the horse barn and there is a thick, heavy buildup of hair, spilled
food, moldy food, used and unused wood shavings, organic waste and liquids along the front edge of each enclosure. An

excessively large number of flies were located on this buildup of material.

Seventeen adult dogs and 19 puppies are housed in horse stalls inside a barn. The floors of the enclosures are consist of
a thick layer of dirt mixed with old dog feces, fresh dog feces, bits of straw, and what appears to be old horse manure.
The dirt and feces mixture covers the entire floor space and the dogs have no ability to escape from this contaminated
flooring material and must be in contact with it at all times. None of the dogs have access to a clean, sanitized floor
space. The dirt, straw and feces cannot be sanitized and sunlight is unable to hit the flooring in any of the horse stalls

resulting in the dogs potential being in direct contact with disease causing agents at all times.

The upper half of the horse stalls consist of metal bars which have an excessively large amount of cobwebs attached to
them. The cobwebs are brown and appear to have trapped a large amount of dust and dirt. Failure to properly sanitize

the enclosures could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once every 2
weeks. The licensee must alter the flooring in a manner that allows for sanitizing of this surface in order to decrease the
risk of disease towards the dogs. The licensee must remove the buildup of waste materials and sanitize all surfaces as
well as ensure that all surfaces of primary enclosures are capable of being sanitized at all times.

Inspection Report

The licensee is housing 10 adult dogs in a building which has not been presented to APHIS officials at previous
inspections. An excessively large number of flies are located in this building. The majority of the flies are located near
the front of each enclosure where there is a large amount of organic material, spilled food and moldy food, and spilled
water. The flies were observed on the gates of the enclosures, on the walls, in the food receptacles and on the dogs.
The inspector did not notice any fly control methods in place inside the building. An excessive number of flies could

increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.

An effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs and cats, and birds and mammals that
are pests, must be established and maintained. The licensee must establish an effective form of fly control in order to
decrease the risk of disease and support the health and well-being of the dogs.

A small, red poodle puppy is under veterinary treatment, but there is no medical record that exists of the treatment plan

for this puppy.

Documenting veterinary care concerns assists APHIS officials in confirming that problems have been identified and

treatment has been sought in a timely manner, as well as establishes a documented medical history for the animal.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records which include the date and description of the problem (such as disease,

Terminal facilities.

A female poodle is contained in a transport crate sitting along the driveway in direct sunlight. The dog is showing signs of
heat stress and the ambient temperature is 97 degrees F with a heat index of 119 degrees F according to the inspectors
Kestrel. A heat advisory has been issued for the area. Failure to provide protection from the direct rays of the sun could

cause the dog to become overheated which could have a detrimental impact on their health and well-being.

Shade must be provided that is sufficient to protect the dog from the direct rays of the sun. The licensee must ensure that

all dogs housed in transport enclosures have sufficient shade as protection from the direct rays of the sun in order to

support their health and well-being.

Details of Search: on 28-July-2021, I joined IDALS inspectors at the
property to look at the dogs and their housing. Daniel arrived at the
location to walk us through. Daniel had told me that the building only
contained young dogs between the ages of 8 weeks and 6 months. Several older
dogs were found in the building and one dog appeared pregnant. I asked Daniel
where all the dogs came from and he said he had raised them all except for a
couple Dobermans that came from Wilbur Nisley who is a USDA licensed breeder.

The property consists of a large unfinished horse barn. The barn meets the
definition of outdoor housing and has large openings along the north, east
and south walls to allow entrance into the building. Approximately 150 dogs
are housed in the barn and consists of juveniles and adults of numerous
different breeds.

The dogs are housed in enclosures constructed of chain-link fencing and the
chain link is broken creating sharp points in at least one enclosure. The
dogs had also dug under the fencing of one enclosure and were seen passing
through this hole into the next enclosure.

Several enclosures are extremely over crowded containing approximately 25
dogs each.

The flooring of the enclosures is gravel and wood shavings. The sunlight is
unable to touch the floors and the gravel cannot be sanitized. Many of the
chain-link fence panels are sitting on wooden boards which are not sealed.
One enclosure has a wall constructed of unsealed wood.

21-05783_000355


## Daniel Gingerich 42-A-1632_page_356
The water provided to the dogs is no longer potable, but is dirty with
shavings floating in the water.

The temperature in the building was 92 degrees with a heat index of 109
degrees. Several of the older dogs appeared to be heat stressed.

There was no effective pest control program in place and there was an
enormous amount of flies present. In some parts of the enclosures, the
floors were covered with large black spots that ended up being a
concentration of flies.

One Cocker spaniel was seen pacing in circles. Daniel said it was blind that
was why it walked endlessly in circles. Daniel has no medical record for
this dog.

A small dead poodle was found outside of the south door to the barn. Daniel
said his employees had dropped a gate on it which killed it.

Areas of clutter are located near the dog enclosures and a drain is clogged
resulting in a large pool of water on the floor near the dog enclosures.

None of the enclosures have a shelter.

The dogs had no official ID and these dogs are not documented on APHIS form
7005.

Both myself and IDALS spoke with Daniel about what he needed to do with the
facility to become compliant. He asked if we could give him until August 15%
to fix the non-compliances in the building and i stated it would be up to my
management whether he could have until the August 15% or not. Daniel said he
intended to auction these dogs and others in January. I stated that no
regulated activity could be conducted from this location until it was
approved.

Type: FOCUSED INSPECTION
Date: 29-JUL-2021

2.40(b)(2) Repeat
Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).

The licensee is storing a bottle of Dexamethasone Injection on a shelf in the large whelping building. The temperature in
the area the bottle is stored in is 91 degrees F according to the inspector's Kestrel. The instructions on the label state that
Dexamethasone should be stored between 68 degrees and 77 degrees F. Failure to store medical products at proper
temperatures may compromise their ability to be effective and the health of the animal may suffer.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee

must store the Dexamethasone and all other medical products at the required temperatures at all times.

Male Shih tzu (#477) has excessively overgrown toenails on the front feet. When the dog stands on a solid surface the
toenails splay out sideways across the flooring and the toenails have developed a severe curve. Overgrown toenails
could cause pain and discomfort as well as affect the dog’s natural gait.

Each dealer must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease and injuries. The licensee

must trim the dog’s toenails to an appropriate length and ensure the toenails of all dogs are kept at a proper length at all

times.

Inspection Report

Handling of animals.
Numerous adult dogs and puppies located throughout the facility are showing signs of heat stress including:

At least 12 adult Cavalier spaniels are housed outdoors. All the dogs were exhibiting signs of heat stress such as open
mouth breathing, high respiration rates, and tongues extending out of the mouth beyond the teeth. Several of the dogs
had a raspy sound associated with their breathing.

In both the sheltered housing building and the large whelping building the majority of puppies under the age of 7 weeks
were observed showing signs of heat stress such as open mouth breathing, high respiration rates, and tongues extended
out of the mouths. Puppies were also observed spread out across the enclosure floor with their legs sprawled out.

In an outdoor enclosure containing approximately 8 dogs, the dogs were showing signs of stress from the heat and 4
dogs were observed lying down in a muddy area where there is an accumulation of liquid waste that overflows or leaks
from a drainpipe running parallel to the enclosure. This muddy area is also in the shade, so the dogs were sitting in the
waste as they sought relief from the extreme temperatures. These dogs, soiled with contaminated mud, are at increased
risk of disease.

The temperatures taken throughout the facility by the inspectors Kestrel ranged from 91-97 degrees F with a heat index
up to 125 degrees F. On the day of the inspection, The National Weather Service had issued a heat advisory for the
area.

Heat stress can be detrimental to the health and well-being of the animals and can even result in death.

When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to
alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity,
and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being. The licensee must alter the temperature to a level that is

comfortable for the dogs. The licensee must ensure the dogs are maintained in appropriate climatic conditions at all times.

Inspection Report

Housing facilities, general.
The waste from the sheltered housing building is run through a pipe that lays on top of the ground and runs alongside of

an outdoor dog enclosure. Liquid waste is flowing from the pipe and through the dog enclosure, containing
approximately 8 dogs, and the dogs were observed lying down in the waste. The areas near the liquid waste are covered
in a green algae and there is a large amount of mud around the stream of waste. It is thought that the pipe may be
leaking or that waste overflows the pipe where it leaves the building. Drainage of waste through the dog enclosure may
allow the dogs to become contaminated and increase the risk of disease.

The pipe leading from the septic system of the house is dumping wastewater down a slope that is causing the water to
pool in one corner of an outdoor enclosure containing approximately 9 Bernese Mountain dogs. The dogs can come into
direct contact with this pool of standing water. The stream of waste running down the slope is located near the fencing of
the enclosure and has a created a large amount of mud containing green algae. Numerous wasps were seen landing on
the wet, muddy areas near the dog enclosure.

Housing facilities must dispose of animal and food waste, water and other fluids in a manner that minimizes contamination
and disease risk. Drainage systems must minimize pest infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. All drains must
be properly constructed, installed and maintained. The licensee must alter the drainpipes in a manner that eliminates the
waste from entering the dog enclosures and keeps the areas around the dog enclosures free of waste material. The
licensee must ensure that all drains are working properly at all times.

3.6(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
Two puppies are located in the basement under the house and are contained in enclosures constructed of coated wire.

One puppy does not have 6 inches of space between the top of his head and the top of the enclosure when in a normal

standing position. The inspectors used a tape measure to determine that the puppy had only approximately 2.5 inches of

space between the top of its head and the top of the enclosure. Failure to provide appropriate head space could limit the
puppy’s freedom of movement which could have a negative impact on its health and well-being.

The interior height of a primary enclosure must be at least 6 inches higher than the head of the tallest dog in the
enclosure when it is in a normal standing position. The licensee must provide the puppy with 6 inches of space between
the top of it’s head and the top of the enclosure in order to support its health and well-being. The licensee must ensure
that all dogs are housed in primary enclosures which are compliant at all times.

To be corrected by: 06-August-2021

3.9(b) Repeat

Feeding

In one outdoor enclosure, containing 4 adult dogs, the licensee has attached a hose that is spraying water into the air to
help cool the dogs. The water is spraying into the metal self-feeder that is attached to the fence and has the protective
push door open. The food in the feeder has become fully saturated and soggy and the feed scattered on the ground is
also saturated and soggy. Dog food soaked in water may cause the food to deteriorate or become moldy, caked and
unpalatable.

Food receptacles must be located so as to minimize contamination. Measures must be taken to prevent molding, caking
and deterioration of the feed. The licensee must locate this metal feeder in an area of the enclosure that will eliminate the
risk of the feed getting wet by the water from the hose. The licensee must ensure that all food for the dogs is protected
from contamination at all times.

To be corrected by: The licensee moved the feeder to a dry and removed the contaminated feed at the time of the

inspection.

Inspection Report

At least 14 dogs contained in outdoor housing have non potable water in their water receptacles. The water is a brown
color and has a layer of sediment built up on the inside of the receptacle. Dogs were observed to be standing and digging
in the water receptacles and dogs were observed drinking the non potable water. The temperature in the outdoor area
was at least 94 degrees F with a heat index up to 125 degrees F according to the inspectors Kestrel. A heat advisory
issued by the National Weather Service was in affect for the area.

Failure to provide potable water could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dogs.

Potable water must be continuously available to the dogs. The licensee must provide potable water to the dogs and
ensure they have access to potable water at all times.

3.13(b)(2) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.

A Samoyed puppy was under a treatment plan from a licensed veterinarian, but there is no documentation of the
treatment plan.

Female Shih tzu #389 and female Shih tzu #479 have both received treatment for medical conditions. The only
documentation indicating these dogs have received treatment is a written statement that says “Shih tzu 389 +479 were
treated 7-28-21. There is no documentation of the actual medical problem for either dog, or for the treatment that was
provided.

Failure to fully document medical conditions and treatment plans does not allow APHIS officials to ensure the animals are
receiving adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer shall keep copies of medical records which include the description of the condition, examination findings,
treatments provided, and procedures performed. The licensee must ensure that all medical issues are documented and

all medical records are complete and contain all required information.

Male Cavalier (#11) has an abnormal appearance to the left eye. A greenish-grey colored discharge is coating the upper
and lower eyelid with the hair beneath the eye containing larger clumps of discharge. The white of the eye is slightly
reddened. The dog has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for the condition of the eye and is not receiving

treatment. Abnormal conditions of the eye could cause pain and discomfort to the animal.

Female Golden retriever (#88) has a thin body condition. The dog appears underweight and her hip bones and backbone
were visible to the inspectors. There is very little body fat and muscle covering her frame. The dog was recently
examined by a licensed veterinarian, but the medical records contain no information concerning her poor body condition
and she is not under any treatment. A thin body condition could indicate an underlying health issue or the need for a

dietary change.

Female Pug (#431) has a an abnormal condition of the left front foot. Two large, round growths are located between the
middle toes of the foot. The growths are located one in front of the other with one that is slightly reddened and the other
growth is moderately reddened. Abnormal foot conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the animal. This dog has

not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for the condition of her foot and is not receiving treatment. Abnormal foot

Female Pug (#15) has an abnormal condition of the right front foot. A large, round growth is located between the middle
toes of the foot. The growth is moderately reddened with an area of liquid discharge coming from the surface. The hair
around the affected area appears wet. This dog has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for the condition of her

foot and is not receiving treatment.

Female Golden retriever (#882) was observed to be exhibiting slight lameness in a her left hind leg while moving around
her enclosure. Closer inspection of the dog revealed a large, round lesion on the inner toe. The lesion is dark red in color
and the surface appears to be wet. Some of the hair located around the affected area is wet. This dog has not been

evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for the condition of her foot and is not receiving treatment.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. The above
mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective
treatment plan. The facility must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times. The dogs were

Inspection Report

Additionally, 2 bottles of a topical spray are lying on their side in the refrigerator. The label on the bottles states that the

product is to be stored upright.

Failure to store medical products appropriately may interfere with their effectiveness and the health of the animals could

suffer.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. The facility must

ensure that all medical products are properly stored at all times in order to support the health of the dogs.

3.13(a)(3)
Veterinary care for dogs.

The Program of Veterinary Care is incomplete.

The section for ectoparasites is lacking how often the treatment will be applied to the adult dogs and puppies.

The section for blood parasites states "heartguard as needed", but there is no documentation that defines the phrase "as

needed".

The plan for sampling dogs for blood parasites and intestinal parasites, including the number of animals to be sampled, is

missing.

Failure to have a complete program on veterinary care does not ensure the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

2.40(b)(2) Repeat
Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).

A female Bernese Mountain Dog ( no ID) had a hairless spot on the right flank of the dog. The spot extended from the
spine down the right flank and from the right hip point forward approximately 9 inches. The entire hairless spot was
approximately 4 inches wide and 6 inches long. The 4x6 area had lesions that had a yellow scab like material on parts of
it, with reddish skin around these areas. There were also some areas that appeared to have a red discharge mixed in with
the areas with the yellow scab like material. This same dog had hair matts behind both ears, about the same size as the
ears. The licensee was not aware of this dogs' condition. Hair loss and skin lesions could be the result of injury, infection
or other veterinary medical condition which could negatively affect the health of the dog and/or may be uncomfortable.
Hair matts can be uncomfortable and can lead to skin issues. The licensee must consult a veterinarian about this skin
condition and remove the hair matts. The licensee must document the treatment of the dog.

2.50(a)(1) Repeat

Time and method of identification.

The Bernese Mountain dog cited in 2.40(b)(2) did not have an ID. Failure to have official identification applied to each dog
does not allow the inspectors to identify the dog and could interfere in the ability to connect medical records and other

documentation to the dog. The licensee must ensure that all dogs be identified as described in 2.51.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).

Female Cocker spaniel (#187) was in a dog fight the previous day and received injuries. The entire left hind leg is
severely swollen and is extremely hot to the inspector's touch. Multiple lacerations are located on the inside, outside and
backside of the leg. A dry dark red blood-like material is coating the hair on the backside of the leg. The dog is non-
weight bearing on the affected leg. The center of the lower lid of the right eye has a tear and is reddened and inflamed.
Drainage is located from the corner of the eye down the side of the face and dark material is attached to the hair in this
area. The white of the eye is moderately reddened. One upper left cheek tooth is loose and easily moved when gently
touched by the inspector. The tooth appeared to be completely dislodged and held in the mouth by a small piece of gum
tissue. The gum tissue at the top of the tooth is reddened and inflamed. A large laceration is located along the top of the
right side of the neck and shoulder area. The facility representative is treating the dog with penicillin and Furazone, but

the animal has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and the treatment plan has not been approved.

Untreated areas with inflammation, lacerations, and dislodged teeth can be indicate further health complications. Broken

teeth and lacerations could cause pain and discomfort to the animal.

incorrect. Form 7005 has the facility representative as whom the dogs were acquired from, but the licensee had told the
inspector that the dogs were transferred to the location from a neighboring unlicensed facility. Inaccurate acquisition

information interferes with the ability of APHIS official's to trace the movements of dogs between different owners.

Each dealer must make, keep and maintain records which fully and correctly include the name and address of the person
from whom a dog or cat was purchased or otherwise acquired whether or not the person is required to be licensed or
registered under the Act. The licensee must input the correct acquisition information onto APHIS form 7005 for each dog.

The licensee must also ensure that APHIS 7005 contains accurate information at all times.

Inspection Report

Housing facilities, general.
One enclosure, housing 3 puppies, is constructed of coated wire panels. One side of the flooring is no longer attached to

the bottom of a side panel creating a gap that the foot of a puppy could pass through. Gaps in flooring large enough to

allow a foot to pass through could cause injury to the dogs.

Housing facilities for dogs and cats must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be
kept in good repair and they must protect the animals from injury. The licensee must alter the flooring of the enclosure in

a manner that eliminates the gap. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.

To be corrected by: 07-August-2021

3.1(b)
Housing facilities, general.
A large amount of clutter is located in the housing area adjacent to the dog enclosures. The clutter consists of large piles

of wood, rolls of wire, buckets, and pieces of metal. The clutter could attract pests such as rodents and can accumulate

dust and dirt.

Housing facilities and areas used for storing animal food or bedding must be free of any accumulation of trash, waste
material, junk, weeds, and other discarded materials. Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free
of clutter, including equipment, furniture, and stored material, but may contain materials actually used and necessary for
cleaning the area, and fixtures or equipment necessary for proper husbandry practices. The licensee must remove all the

clutter from the dog housing area and ensure that the area remains free of clutter at all times.

3.1(e)
Housing facilities, general.

The facility uses wood shavings in their dog enclosures and a large stack of stored shavings are sitting directly on the
floor. Bags of shavings stored directly on the floor could attract rodents and interfere with proper cleaning of the storage

area.

Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and
vermin infestation. The supplies must be stored off the floor and away from the walls, to allow cleaning underneath and
around the supplies. The licensee must ensure the stored bags of shavings are not placed directly on the floor in order to

allow for proper cleaning of the storage area and to reduce the attraction of pests.

To be corrected by: 11-August-2021

3.1(f)
Housing facilities, general.

Open bags of trash are located in the housing area containing a majority of the adult dogs and all the puppies. Open

bags of trash could create odors and attract pests such as flies and mice.

Trash containers in housing facilities and in food storage and food preparation areas must be leakproof and must have
tightly fitted lids on them at all times. The licensee must ensure that all trash is placed in a leak-proof container with a

tightly fitted lid at all times.

3.4(b)
Outdoor housing facilities.

One enclosure, housing 4 dogs, does not have enough shelter space. The available shelter space is not large enough to

allow each animal to sit, stand and lie in a normal manner or to turn about freely.

Four enclosures have no shelter at all. A total of 2 adults and 13 puppies are housed in these enclosures.

Inadequate shelter space or no shelter at all does not ensure the dogs can escape temperature and weather extremes

which could have a negative impact on their health and well-being.

Outdoor facilities for dogs or cats must include one or more shelter structures that are accessible to each animal in each
outdoor facility, and that are large enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal
manner, and to turn about freely. The licensee must add shelters to the enclosures that provide enough space to

compliantly contain the animals.

To be corrected by: 11-August-2021

3.11(b)(2)
Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

The facility representative stated the surfaces of the enclosures are only sanitized once a month. Failure to properly

sanitize surfaces could increase the risk of disease hazards towards the dogs.

Inspection Report

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once every 2
weeks. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces in contact with the dogs are sanitized at least once every two weeks in

order to support the health of the dogs and decrease the risk of disease.

A male poodle puppy (DOB 07-01-21, dam #281) was observed lying flat on his right side. The puppy was completely

non-responsive, gasping for breath, and occasionally cried out. The puppy was removed from the enclosure and hung
limply from the facility representatives hands, displayed jerking movements of the head and then rolled its head upward
toward the ceiling. The puppy's head then limply rolled back and forth as the facility representative moved the animal
around and he continued to gasp for air. An APHIS Veterinary Medical Officer gently examined the puppy, but
determined that it had died. The facility representative stated that employees had been cleaning the kennel that morning,

but she had not been alerted that the puppy was in distress.

Failure to identify the puppy was in distress has resulted in the death of the animal.

In at least two outdoor enclosures, containing a total of four adult dogs, the dogs have dug holes located along the bottom
of the fencing. The holes are large enough to allow a dog to pass through and escape the enclosure. The facility has

placed wooden boards across the top of one of the holes in an attempt to stop the dogs from escaping the enclosure.

Previously, the facility had a dog dig under the fencing and escape its enclosure and was then killed by other dogs.

Failure of the enclosure to contain the dogs could result in injury and even the death of the animal.

Housing facilities for dogs and cats must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be
kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury, and contain the animals securely. The licensee must
alter the enclosure in a manner to ensure the dogs cannot dig out of their enclosure in order to ensure their safety and

well-being.

In another outdoor enclosure, containing a total of four adult dogs, the dogs have dug a large hole under the fence and
the facility has placed part of a metal livestock panel across the top of the hole. The openings in the livestock panel are

large enough for the dogs' feet and legs to fall through which could result in an injury to the animal.

One covered outdoor enclosure contains three dogs who have access to a large plastic container that serves as a shelter.
The plastic container has split apart beneath the access door creating a large gap. The gap is large enough to allowa

dog's neck or leg to become entrapped which could result in a serious injury.

In one enclosure, containing one adult dog, the wall is covered in tile, but the tile along the back wall is broken exposing

the interior materials within the wall. Direct contact with these materials could cause injury to the dog.

Two dogs have access to a water bucket with a broken handle. Contact with the broken handle may cause injury to the

animals.

The facility uses carpet squares as bedding material for puppies. In at least three enclosures, containing a total of
approximately two adult dogs and eight puppies, the carpet squares have been damaged and shredded into long strands.

The damaged carpets could cause injury should the animals swallow the strands or become entangled in them.

The drains for the sheltered housing building and the covered outdoor runs transports waste directly outside the building's
exterior walls. The drain on the northwest corner has created a large pool of wet fecal and food waste, hair, and straw.

The wet pile has built-up against the lower portion of the exterior wall and has attracted a large number of flies.

The drain on the southwest corner of the sheltered building dumps into PVC pipes that lie on top of the ground and
transports the waste down a hill and away from the building.

A large pool of stagnant waste material is located directly along the exterior wall of the sheltered building and appears to
originate from the PVC pipe which has been duct taped in several areas. As the PVC pipe moves down the hill it runs
parallel to one outdoor enclosure that contains two adult dogs. A small area of liquid waste from the pipe is located in the

dog enclosure.

A PVC pipe that carries waste out of the sheltered building runs through a covered outdoor enclosure which contains two
dogs. The pipe stops short of the end of the enclosure resulting in the waste from inside the building pooling on the floor
of the enclosure. The inspectors observed the waste from the pipe dripping directly onto the the enclosure flooring and a

large pile of wet feces was located at the end of the pipe.

In the large open barn, there is a drain in the floor located near the dog enclosures that is not draining properly resulting in

a large pool of water on the floor. Four adult dogs are housed in this building.

Inspection Report

Outdoor housing facilities.

At least one of the covered outdoor enclosures, housing a total of two huskies, does not have a shelter that is large
enough to accommodate all the dogs in the enclosure compliantly. Four dogs are housed in a large open barn, but none
of these dogs have access to a shelter. Failure to provide a shelter or a shelter with sufficient space may result in the

inability of a dog to escape adverse weather conditions and the health and well-being of the animal could suffer.

Outdoor enclosures must include one or more shelter structures that are accessible to each animal and that are large
enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. The
licensee must provide each dog housed in an outdoor enclosure with access to a compliant shelter in order to support
their health and well-being.

3.4(c) Repeat

Outdoor housing facilities.

In two outdoor enclosures, containing a total of six adult dogs, the wood floors or wood frames inside the shelters had
been painted. The paint has been worn and scratched off by the dogs resulting in exposed wood that is no longer
impervious to moisture and is in contact with the animals. Wood that is not impervious to moisture could rot and lose

structural integrity and cannot be properly sanitized potentially increasing the risk of disease towards the dogs.

Building surfaces in contact with animals in outdoor housing facilities must be impervious to moisture. The licensee must
alter the wood inside the shelters in a manner that makes it impervious to moisture. The licensee must ensure that all

surfaces in contact with the dogs is impervious to moisture at all times.

Inspection Report

Metal self-feeders are provided to the dogs housed in the covered outdoor enclosures. In at least two enclosures,
containing a total of two adult dogs, the dog food in the feeders has become coated in a greenish-white substance that
appears to be mold. The moldy food is located underneath the fresh food and is caked together. Food contaminated by

mold could have a negative impact on the health of the dogs should they consume it.

In at least five enclosures, housing a total of approximately five adult dogs and twelve puppies, the metal food bowls are
full of wood shavings that are currently used to absorb waste from the dogs. The large amount of used shavings inside
the food bowls is making it nearly impossible for the dogs to access their food. Food that is not readily accessible to the

dogs may have a negative impact on their health and well-being.

Food receptacles must be used for dogs and cats, must be readily accessible to all dogs and cats, and must be located
so as to minimize contamination. Measures must be taken to ensure that there is no molding, deterioration, and caking of
feed. The licensee must remove the moldy food and wood shavings from the metal feeders and bowls and ensure that all
food provided to the dogs remains free of mold, wood shavings and other contaminates in order to support the health of
the dogs.

3.10(a) Repeat

Watering

At least five adult dogs and five puppies have no access to potable water. The water receptacles are either empty or
have an excessive amount of wood shavings floating in the water and four puppies have flies floating in the water in their

water receptacle.

Failure to provide potable water could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dogs.

Inspection Report

Potable water must be continuously available to the dogs. The licensee must provide potable water to the dogs and
ensure they have access to potable water at all times.
3.11(b)(2) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

Four adult dogs are housed in a large barn. The floors of the enclosures consist of gravel, dirt and wood shavings. The
gravel, dirt and wood shavings cannot be sanitized and sunlight is unable to hit the flooring in any of the enclosures
resulting in the dogs potentially being in direct contact with disease causing agents at all times. The inspectors also

observed that the floors were swarming with flies.

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks
and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
The licensee must alter the flooring in a manner that allows for sanitizing of the surface in order to decrease the risk of
disease towards the dogs.

3.11(b)(4) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

At least two outdoor shelters, accessed by a total of six dogs, contain straw bedding material. The majority of the straw
bedding is dark in color and compacted together in a solid pile and the inspector had to pull the layers of straw apart.
Some of the layers of straw were wet, dirty, and had a strong odor of mold. One of the affected shelters has blue plastic

mixed in with the dirty straw bedding material.

Bedding material contaminated by waste, mold, dirt and trash may cause the animals to become wet and soiled as well as

raise the risk of disease hazards.

Pens, runs, and outdoor housing areas using material that cannot be sanitized using the methods provided in the
regulations, such as gravel, sand, grass, earth, or absorbent bedding, must be sanitized by removing the contaminated
material as necessary to prevent odors, diseases, pests, insects, and vermin infestation. The licensee must ensure that all
contaminated bedding material is removed from the shelters as often as necessary to prevent soiling of the animals, as
well as eliminate odors, insects and disease hazards.

3.11(d) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

An excessively large number of flies are located in the large open barn. The barn has open doors located on the north,
south, east, and west walls with no screens covering these openings. Four adult dogs are housed in this building and
flies are covering or swarming around the enclosure floors, feces, food, fencing, and the animals. No fly control methods

were visible in the barn.

Excessive numbers of flies and other insects can contaminate food and water as well as cause health hazards towards

the dogs.

An effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs and cats, and birds and mammals that
are pests, must be established and maintained. The licensee must establish an effective plan to control flies and other
pests in order to support the health of the dogs. The licensee must ensure the plan is effective at all times.

Inspection Report

The program of veterinary care is incomplete. The section for parasites states:

Bloodparasites: 10% every other monthly

Intestinal parasites: 10% every other monthly (fen/benmetro and Toltazurl)

The sections for blood parasites does not define the plan for sampling and treatment. The section for intestinal parasites
does not define the plan for sampling and/or a complete treatment plan for adult dogs and puppies. The facility
representative did not know what the blood parasite and intestinal parasite statements written on the PVC were supposed

to mean.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian that includes sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests (including fleas,
worms, coccidia, giardia, and heartworm). The licensee must define in writing a complete plan for sampling and treatment

of blood parasites and intestinal parasites.

To be corrected by: 19-August-2021

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.

Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the age or date of birth of

the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all required information is provided including the age or date of birth for each

animal.

2.50(a)(2)
Time and method of identification.

Approximately 28 weaned puppies less than 16 weeks of age are not maintained in distinct litters, but are co-mingled
together in 3 separate enclosures. The puppies do not have any form of official identification. Failure to provide official

identification interferes with the ability of APHIS officials to identify dogs and trace their movements.

Live puppies, less than 16 weeks of age, shall be identified by either an official tag, legible tattoo marking approved by the
Administrator, a plastic-type collar containing the required information, a microchip, or by a cage card as long as the
puppies are maintained in a distinct litter and reside at the facility which they were born. The licensee must apply an
official form of identification to each of the puppies and the licensee must also ensure that all dogs at the facility have an

official form of identification at all times.

Cats on Hand). Failure to maintain records of all animals at the facility interferes with the ability of APHIS officials to

identify dogs and trace their movements.

Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the required information
for all dogs acquired, owned, held, controlled, transported, euthanized, sold or otherwise disposed of. The licensee must
input the required information for each of these puppies onto APHIS form 7005. The licensee must ensure that all dogs

are properly documented at all times.

3.1(e)
Housing facilities, general.

The facility uses wood shavings in the enclosures to absorb waste from the dogs. One open bag of shavings is sitting on

the floor in a corner of the kennel. Open bags of shavings are at risk of contamination from pests such as flies or mice.

All open supplies of food and bedding must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination
and spoilage. The licensee must place the open bag of wood shavings into a leakproof container with a tightly fitted lid in
order to protect it from potential contamination. The licensee must ensure all open supplies of food and bedding are

properly stored at all times.

Inspection Report

The facility uses a plastic scoop to place dog food from the food container into the metal self-feeders. Approximately one-
third of the interior surface of this plastic scoop is coated in a thick buildup of a brown organic material. The facility
representative stated that the scoop was previously used to feed horses and the buildup came from an additive applied to
the horse feed. A buildup of organic material on the scoop could cause contamination of the dog feed and increase the

risk of disease hazards.

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and
more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. The
licensee must clean and sanitize the plastic scoop in order to remove the buildup of material and to eliminate the risk of
food contamination. The licensee must ensure all food receptacles are free of a buildup of potential disease hazards at all

times in order to support the health of the animals.

To be corrected by: 08 September 2021

3.13(a)(3)
Veterinary care for dogs.

The licensee's Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) is incomplete. The following sections state:

Ectoparasites: every 2 weeks

Blood parasites: monthly

Intestinal parasites: bi-monthly

Each of these sections is missing the name and dosage of the products that are to be used and the PVC does not

accurately reflect how often adult dogs and puppies receive the treatments. The facility representative stated that the
ectoparasite treatment is not given year round, but only during the warm months and the intestinal parasite treatment for
puppies might be given at intervals other than bi-monthly. The plan to sample for heartworm and intestinal parasites is
also missing from the document. A complete Program of Veterinary Care is necessary for APHIS officials to determine

the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.
Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary dare for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian. The missing information must be added to the Program of Veterinary Care and the

licensee must ensure that the Program of Veterinary Care contains all the required information at all times.

Female Bichon puppy is observed lying in her enclosure while all her litter mates are actively moving around. The puppy
appears lethargic and dull and physical inspection of the animal by the Veterinary Medical Officer revealed that her

extremities, including her ears, are cold to the touch, her abdomen is swollen and she has a rapid respiration rate with an
increased effort on inhalation. A small amount of discharge is coming from the nose. The facility representative had not

noticed the puppy's condition and she has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and is not under any treatment.

Female Golden retriever puppy (tag #707, DOB 06-01-21) appears lethargic, dull and depressed. Physical inspection of
the puppy revealed her extremities, including her ears, are cold to the touch while her body feels hot. All four legs are
swollen, as well as her muzzle, which has a spongy feel to it. Palpation of her abdomen revealed that it may be full of
fluid. The dog is housed with 15 other puppies, but she remained laying on the ground while the majority of the other
puppies actively moved around the enclosure. The puppy is being treated for a cough, intestinal parasites and external
parasites, but she has never been physically examined by a licensed veterinarian and a veterinarian has not evaluated

the dog for her current condition.

including her ears, felt cold to the touch while her body felt hot. Discharge is coming from the nose, the 3rd eyelids on
both eyes are elevated, and the puppy was observed to be drooling. The puppy was also coughing nearly continuously
during the inspection of the animals and the enclosure. The puppy is being treated for a cough, intestinal parasites and
external parasites, but she has never been physically examined by a licensed veterinarian and a veterinarian has not

evaluated the dog for her current condition.

Female Golden retriever (tag #581, DOB 07/2021) is emaciated. Physical examination of the puppy by the Veterinary
Medical Officer revealed very little fat covering her frame and her ribs, hips, and backbone were easily felt and the
backbone is prominent with sunken muscles along both sides. The Veterinary Medical Officer determined the animal has
a Body Condition Score of 3 out of 9. The puppy's extremities, including the ears, felt cold to the touch while her body felt
hot. A small amount of discharge was noticed from both nostrils. The puppy is being treated for a cough, intestinal
parasites and external parasites, but she has never been physically examined by a licensed veterinarian and a

veterinarian has not evaluated the dog for her current condition.

Lethargic, depressed behavior could be an indication that an animal is ill and feeling unwell. During the inspection of the
facility on July 29, 2021, the licensee stated to the inspectors that this site has experienced confirmed positive cases of
Parvovirus in several of their dogs throughout the month of July. Discharge from the nose, abnormal body temperatures,

and poor body condition could indicate an underlying health issue including serious diseases.

Female poodle (tag #371) has an emaciated body condition. The dog has very little fat or muscle covering her frame and
the ribs, backbone, and hip bones are easily felt beneath the haircoat. The Veterinary Medical Officer who physically

examined the animal determined it had a Body Condition Score of 3 out of 9. The facility representative has not noticed

the condition of this animal and she has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and is not under a treatment plan.

Emaciated body condition could indicate a serious underlying health issue.

Male Australian shepherd (tag #272) has poor dental health. Nearly the entire surface of the upper left cheek teeth are
coated in a thick brown tartar. The majority of the surface of the upper left canine tooth and front teeth are also coated in
a dark brown tartar. The entire surface of the lower left cheek teeth are covered in dark brown tartar. The gums are
moderately reddened with a darker red line running along the gum line of all the upper left teeth. The inspectors were not
able to view the right side of the dog's mouth as the animal became to dangerous to handle. The facility representative
had not noticed the condition of the dog's teeth and he has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and is not under

a treatment plan.

Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as lead to further health issues.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The above
mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to establish an effective
treatment plan. The licensee must ensure all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times. The facility

representative had the dogs transported to a licensed veterinarian at the time of the inspection.

Female Cavalier (#325) has extremely overgrown toenails. The toenails of the front feet have grown excessively long and

have developed a severe curve.

Female Pomsky (#582) has extremely overgrown toenails. The toenails of the left front foot have grown excessively long

and have developed a severe curve.

Overgrown toenails could cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as affect the dog's natural gait.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must trim the dogs' toenails to an appropriate length and ensure that the toenails of all dogs are properly maintained at all
times.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).

The licensee and facility representative told APHIS officials that there have been cases of Parvovirus at their kennel that
has been on-going for the past few months. During the current inspection, a random sampling of just five litters of
puppies revealed that no less than eleven puppies had died from Parvovirus according to the facility representative. The
licensee has also sold puppies which have tested positive for Parvovirus and Distemper. The inspector asked the facility
representative if the attending veterinarian is aware of the Parvovirus issues and he said he did not know if the Attending
Veterinarian knew. The inspector called the Attending Veterinarian who confirmed that he was not aware of the

Parvovirus cases and the licensee had never spoken to him about it.

Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems, in a timely manner, can result in prolonged pain and

suffering and the increased risk of development of serious medical conditions.

licensee is vaccinating for Distemper at 4, 5, 6, and 7 weeks of age.

Failure to follow the vaccination schedule in the Program of Veterinary Care, which has been reviewed and signed by the
facilities Attending Veterinarian, does not ensure the puppies are receiving appropriate protection against serious and

deadly diseases including Parvovirus and Distemper.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian and includes a schedule for the vaccination of contagious and /or deadly diseases of
dogs. The licensee must follow the vaccination schedule documented in the Program of Veterinary Care to ensure the

puppies are receiving adequate protection against contagious and/or deadly diseases.

Inspection Report

The Program of Veterinary Care is incomplete. The section for parasites states:

Ectoparasites: 10% weekly- Frontline spray
Bloodparasites: 10% every other monthly

Intestinal parasites: 10% every other monthly (fen/benmetro and Toltazurl)

The facility representative was not sure what the statement for ectoparasites is supposed to mean and he has not been
using Frontline spray. The facility representative did not know what the blood parasite and intestinal parasite statements

are supposed to mean.

The sections for blood parasites does not define the plan for sampling and treatment. The section for intestinal parasites

does not define the plan for sampling and the plan for treatment of adult dogs and puppies.

An incomplete Program of Veterinary Care does not ensure that prevention and treatment of parasites is conducted

appropriately which could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dogs.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian that includes sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests (including fleas,
worms, coccidia, giardia, and heartworm). The licensee must define in writing a complete plan for sampling and treatment

of ectoparasites, blood parasites and intestinal parasites.

Inspection Report

Veterinary care for dogs.

The licensee uses cage cards to document when and what type of vaccinations the puppies receive while at the facility.
The licensee sold puppies who then tested positive for Parvovirus and/or Distemper. The inspectors received APHIS
form 7006 which listed each of these sick puppies along with an official identification number. The inspectors requested
the cage cards for these sick puppies in order to review the vaccinations that had been administered to the puppies, but
the identification numbers on the cage cards and APHIS form 7006 did not match and the inspectors were unable to

determine if the vaccination records belonged to the sick puppies and if the puppies had ever received the vaccinations.

Female Doberman (tag #487) was previously under a treatment plan. The medical record documenting the treatment she

received does not include her official identification number.

Female Husky (ear tattoo #73) has a medical record containing information concerning an abnormality. The record has
#321 documented as her official identification number, but the dog has #73 tattooed inside her ear and has never been
assigned any other identification number such as a metal tag. The facility representative said they have always referred

to her as #321 as that is what he thought her ear tattoo was.

Medical records and other documents which lack proper animal identification interferes in the ability of APHIS officials to
determine if an animal has received adequate veterinary care including vaccinations for serious and potentially deadly

diseases.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. These

records must include the identity of the animal, including identifying marks, tattoos, or tags on the animal and the animal’s

Veterinary care for dogs.

The licensee is treating 16 golden retriever puppies for fleas with lvomec pour-on. The facility representative stated that
he mixes the Ilvomec pour-on with oil and does not have an exact dosage for applying it to the animals. The facility
representative presented written instructions for the lvomec pour-on that were approved by the Attending Veterinarian, but
the instructions do not include a dosage or the approval for the product to be mixed with oil. An incomplete treatment

plan does not ensure the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Female Doberman (tag #487) was previously receiving veterinary treatment and was re-evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian during the week of September 6th, and it was determined that she requires further treatment. There is no
medical record of this examination or of the new treatment plan. Failure to create and maintain a medical record

interferes with APHIS officials ability to ensure the dog is receiving adequate veterinary care.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. Should a
problem be identified, these records must include the date and a description of the problem, examination findings, test
results, the plan for treatment and care as well as any treatment procedures performed. The licensee must ensure the
plan to use the Ilvomec pour-on is complete with all necessary details and the licensee must also create a medical record
for the Doberman documenting the evaluation and treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that all treatment plans are

fully and completely documented at all times.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).

Female Shih Tzu (tag # 674)has a thick buildup of a dark brown colored organic material on at least half the surface of the
upper right and left canine teeth. The entire surface of the upper cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth are covered ina
greyish-brown colored material. The manager stated that the dog has never been evaluated by a veterinarian.

Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues. The licensee must
have the above mentioned dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to establish an
effective treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times
2.75(a)(1)(v)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
APHIS form 7006 is missing and the disposition date for the puppies is not listed on a cage card or litter record. According

to the site manager, 23 puppies were picked up on September 7, 2021 and moved to an unknown location. The
disposition records are necessary to complete records, identify dogs, and to trace the movements of dogs.

puppy passing through the openings in the wire flooring. Openings in flooring that are large enough for the puppy's feet

and legs to pass through could cause injury to the foot and leg or result in entrapment of the puppy.

Primary enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from injury and
does not allow the dogs' feet/legs to pass through any openings in the floor. The licensee must alter the flooring ina
manner that does not allow the feet/legs of the puppies to pass through the openings. The licensee must ensure that the

flooring of the enclosure is safe for the dogs at all times.

In two enclosures containing 7 dogs, the plastic feeders have chewed, worn and sharp edges on the corners of the
feeders. The dogs are at risk of coming into contact with the sharp edges every time they approach the feeders, which
could result in injury. These edges are also unable to be properly cleaned and sanitized.

In one enclosure containing three dogs, there are two 2x4 wooden boards fixed to the floor and they have been chewed
on the ends creating sharp edges. The dogs are at risk of coming into contact with these sharp edges every time they sit,
lay or walk on or by the boards, which could result in injury. These chewed edges are also unable to be properly cleaned
and sanitized.

In one enclosure containing 1 adult dog and 6 puppies, the wooden floor was improperly sealed and is not impervious to
moisture and can not be properly cleaned and sanitized.

The sharp edges could potentially injure the dogs and the surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized.

All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities that cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of

housing facilities are maintained in good repair at all times.

Female Golden retriever (tag #801, ear tattoo #101, microchip #990000005953800) had a surgical procedure performed

on her abdomen, but the inspector is unable to determine if the procedure is compliant with the requirements to provide

the animal with adequate veterinary care.

The dog was sold by the licensee through an auction on August 20th. The individual who purchased the animal
transported it to a licensed veterinarian the next morning after noticing the dog had an incision in its abdomen that was
reddened and inflamed. Two licensed veterinarians examined the dog and found it to have an abdominal incision that
was 5 to 8 days old which was sutured with fishing line. Both veterinarians concluded that due to the appearance of the
incision along with the inappropriate suturing material, that this procedure had not been performed by a licensed
veterinarian and appeared to be done by someone who had no skill in surgery. The veterinarians also diagnosed the dog

with pyometra resulting in the animal being spayed.

The inspector spoke with an individual who attended the auction and was present when this dog was sold. The individual
said that during the sale of this dog a question was asked about the dog having a c-section scar on her abdomen and the

licensee responded that the dog was bred and stated, "We removed her uterus, implanted it, and put it back in". When

the inspector asked the licensee about this statement, he said it was a lie.

The inspector requested medical records and information from the licensee's kennel manager concerning this dog, but the
manager had no records for this animal. The licensee also told the inspector numerous different stories pertaining to this
dog, which were often contradictory such as the dog had a c-section in June, then decided he didn’t know when the dog
had last whelped, then said the dog had a c-section around July 18th, but then stated at the auction that the dog was
bred. The licensee also told the inspector many times that he didn’t know who performed the surgical procedure on the
animal, but then said the attending veterinarian had done a c-section. The inspector contacted the licensee's attending

veterinarian requesting any medical records and information in regard to this dog, but the inspector received no reply.

The failure to provide accurate information has interfered in the ability of the inspector to determine exactly when the
medical procedure was performed, if the procedure was performed by a qualified individual and if the procedure and

materials used were appropriate in regard to providing adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must ensure that all medical procedures are performed by qualified personnel and all methods and materials used are

appropriate to ensure the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.

A vial of rabies vaccine was found in a cabinet in the sheltered housing building. The label on the rabies vaccines states
that it should be stored at 35-46 degrees F. The temperature in the sheltered housing building is 72 degree F according
to the inspectors Kestrel. Failure to store vaccines at the required temperatures may interfere with their effectiveness,

which could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dogs.

must store the rabies vaccine and all other medical products at the required temperatures in order to support the health

and well-being of the dogs.

The following medical products are located in the sheltered housing building or Whelping building, but they are not

their use in dogs:

o Spectrogard for use in pigs

o Lamb & Kid colostrum powder

o Equispaz paste for use in horses

o Oxytocin for use in horses, sows, cows and ewes

o Aclear plastic bottle which has no label containing a dark colored liquid thought to be iodine

The facility representative is not sure if these products are supposed to be used for the dogs or not. The off-label use of
medical products could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dogs if not first approved by the

attending veterinarian and used per the attending veterinarian’s directions.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must ensure the above mentioned products are approved for use by the attending veterinarian along with instructions for

their use in dogs in order to protect the dogs' health and well-being.

The licensee uses a tag number or ear tattoo number as the official form of identification on APHIS form 7005. The
licensee sold four hundred and eighty-eight dogs through an auction, as well as five dogs to a private individual, but
documented a microchip as the official form of identification on APHIS form 7006 rather than the tag or ear tattoo number.
None of these microchip numbers have been added to APHIS form 7005, therefore, the inspector is unable to determine if

these dogs are actually on any of the licensee's APHIS form 7005s and cannot confirm their acquisition information.

The following puppies were sold by the licensee through an auction, but their acquisition information could not be
presented to the inspectors. The facility representative confirmed that the identification number documented on APHIS
form 7006 is not the same number that is documented on the puppy cage cards or on APHIS form 7005, therefore, the

acquisition information could not be determined.

Inspection Report

The licensee uses cage cards to document when and what type of vaccinations and deworming the puppies receive while
at the facility. The licensee sold approximately eight-three puppies between the age of 8 weeks and 16 weeks through an
auction. The inspectors received APHIS form 7006 which listed each of these puppies along with an official identification
number. The inspectors requested the cage cards for these puppies in order to review the vaccinations and deworming
that had been administered to the puppies, but the facility representative confirmed that the identification numbers on the
cage cards and APHIS form 7006 do not match, therefore, the inspectors were unable to verify if the puppies had ever

received any vaccinations and deworming.

Medical records and other documents which lack proper animal identification interferes in the ability of APHIS officials to
determine if an animal has received adequate veterinary care including treatments or preventatives for serious and

potentially deadly diseases and parasites.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. These
records must include the identity of the animal, including identifying marks, tattoos, or tags on the animal and the animal’s
breed, sex, and age. The licensee must ensure that all documents, including cage cards and APHIS form 7006, contain
the proper identification number in order to allow APHIS officials to determine which animal the paperwork belongs to.
3.13(b)(2) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.

The licensee was treating 16 golden retriever puppies for fleas with lvomec pour-on. The facility representative stated that
he mixes the Ilvomec pour-on with rubbing alcohol and does not have an exact dosage for applying it to the animals. The
facility representative presented written instructions for the lvomec pour-on that has been approved by the Attending

Veterinarian, but the instructions do not include a dosage or the approval for the product to be mixed with rubbing alcohol.

Inspection Report

An incomplete treatment plan does not ensure the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. Should a
problem be identified, these records must include the date and a description of the problem, examination findings, test
results, the plan for treatment and care as well as any treatment procedures performed. The licensee must ensure the
plan to use the lvomec pour-on is complete with all necessary details and the licensee. The licensee must ensure that all

treatment plans are fully and completely documented at all times.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.

Type: ROUTINE INSPECTION

3.9(b)
Feeding

Two metal self feeders, accessed by a total of approximately two adult dogs and three puppies, have an excessive
amount of wood shavings covering the food or mixed within it. The dogs cannot consume the food without potentially

ingesting the wood shavings.

Contaminated food may interfere with a dog's desire to eat and its ability to receive adequate nutrition which could result

in poor body condition, illness, and other serious health issues.

Food receptacles must be located so as to minimize contamination. The licensee must remove all the wood shavings from

the feeders and ensure that all food provided to the dogs is clean and uncontaminated.

To be corrected by: From this day forward

3.13(a)(3) Repeat
Veterinary care for dogs.

Review of the Program of Veterinary Care revealed that vaccination for Parvovirus should be given at 4 weeks of age and

6 weeks of age. The licensee is vaccinating for Parvovirus at 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 weeks of age.

Inspection Report

The schedule for vaccinating for Distemper in the Program of Veterinary Care is 5 weeks and 7 weeks of age. The

licensee is vaccinating for Distemper at 4, 5, 6, and 7 weeks of age.

Failure to follow the vaccination schedule in the Program of Veterinary Care, which has been reviewed and signed by the
licensee's Attending Veterinarian, does not ensure the puppies are receiving appropriate protection against serious and

deadly diseases including Parvovirus and Distemper.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian and includes a schedule for the vaccination of contagious and /or deadly diseases of
dogs. The licensee must follow the vaccination schedule documented in the Program of Veterinary Care to ensure the

puppies are receiving adequate protection against contagious and/or deadly diseases.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.

Dear Applicant:

We received your application for a USDA license under the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) and $10
application fee. Here are the next steps in the licensing process.

What will happen next?

To obtain a license, you must demonstrate compliance with the regulations and standards during a
pre-licensing inspection by a USDA inspector. The inspector will call you within 10 business days
from the date of this letter to schedule a pre-licensing inspection. During this inspection, the USDA
inspector will inspect your animals, facilities, equipment, and records for compliance. Please have the
following documents available for inspection, if applicable: A written program of veterinary care if
you use a part-time attending veterinarian or have consultant arrangements; an exercise plan for dogs;
and/or an environmental enhancement plan for nonhuman primates.

If the inspection reveals any deficiencies, you will have two additional chances to demonstrate
compliance with the regulations and standards.

What happens after I pass the pre-licensing inspection?

The final step in the licensing process is paying the appropriate licensing fee. Copies of your
application and fee schedule are enclosed for your convenience. Based on your current application,
your fee will be $(350.00). After passing the pre-licensing inspection, the inspector will review this
licensing fee to ensure it is the correct amount for you to pay.

Should you have any questions, need to make changes to your application, or need to obtain a new fee
amount based on changes to your application, please contact Sean Rehurek at (970) 494-7482.

Subject: Daniel Gingerich (506618)

On 28-July-2021, | conducted a focused inspection at Daniel Gingerich’s site #001 with 3 employees of
IDALS: Alissa Puffett, Abigail Martens, and Dr. Kevin Taylor. During the inspection, Dr. Taylor asked me
if | knew whether Daniel had any dogs in two buildings located to the east side of his property. | stated
that we had never been taken on an inspection of those two buildings and believed the buildings did not
house dogs. Dr. Taylor said there were dogs in those barns and that we needed to have Daniel show us
the buildings. Dr. Taylor requested to see the buildings and Daniel took us inside both where we found a
total of approximately twenty-five adult dogs and ten puppies along with two dead dogs. One of the adult
dogs was severely emaciated. Neither the buildings nor the enclosures were compliant to house dogs.

Daniel stated that one of the buildings (the horse barn) were dogs that he was boarding for someone
else. Neither myself or the IDALS inspectors could remember the person’s name, but the individual is not
licensed with the USDA or IDALS. Later that day he gave the dogs to Steve Kruse (9245) to take control
of and house compliantly. Daniel moved one of the dogs (an adult female with ten puppies) into his own
whelping building.

| asked Daniel ie had never shown me these buildings, so they could be inspected and he said “I
don’t know wh ever showed you these buildings”. s Daniel’s kennel manager.

| asked Dr. Taylor how he knew Daniel had dogs in these buildings. He stated that he had been to this
location last fall with the Wayne County Sheriffs office due to a complaint. Daniel wasn’t present at the
facility that day, but Dr. Taylor and the Sheriff were given access to the facility and walked through all the
buildings on the property and had found dogs in the two buildings in question at that time. During the
inspection on July 28", Dr. Taylor said he walked near the buildings and could hear dogs barking. That
was when he then told me there were dogs in those buildings and he requested that Daniel show us the
buildings.

On 29-July-2021, | conducted another focused inspection at Daniel Gingerich’s site #001 with Dr. Bill
Janecke, VMO. After completing the inspection of the buildings and areas housing dogs we requested to
walk through all the other buildings on the property. Daniel took us through the other buildings and we
found no dogs inside of them. | then asked to see the basement under his house. | had remember that
either Daniel or {jad at one time mentioned keeping puppies in the basement of the house. Daniel
agreed to show us the basement of the house where we found 2 puppies housed inside stacked wire
crates inside a small closet-like area. Daniel said he had told his wife to get these puppies out of here
and didn’t know why they were still in the basement. Daniel said the puppies were recovering from Parvo
and the AV would be seeing them that evening. One of the puppies appeared depressed and lethargic
and was sitting up and leaning against the side of the enclosure with her eyes closed. She did not appear
to feel well. The other puppy was housed in an enclosure that was not tall enough and there was not 6
inches of space above the puppy’s head and the top of the enclosure. | believe with 100% confidence
that if | had not requested to see the basement, Daniel would not have shown us the puppies kept there.

Dr. Bill Janecke and | conducted a focused inspection at Steve Kruse’s facility in West Pont, IA, on Friday

July 30, 2021, to check on the health of a group of 37 dogs that were transferred from Daniel Gingerich.

We had disposition forms for those dogs in our possession. We conducted the inspection with
employee. Mr. Kruse was not present. No NCI’s were identified during the inspection.

The dogs that had been transported from Daniel Gingerich’s on 7/29/2021 were being kept in group of
enclosures separated from the rest of Steve Kruse’s dogs. We observed a total of 43 dogs that were
transferred from Daniel’s facility on 739 20272 RINGMMMIT e.0 that the 37 dogs for which we had
disposition forms were transferred into the facility on that morning, and 8 additional dogs were
transferred in the late afternoon.

RG dicated ha fi xamined the group of 37 dogs after their arrival at the facility

on morning of 7-29-21. His observations, treatments, and recommendations were documented and are
available at the facility. The dogs were heartworm tested. Two were positive and euthanized b

Photos were taken of the documents and will be uploaded into e-File with Daniel Gingrich’s
inspection report. IG noted “DAN” in his notes for some of the dogs. We inquired what DAN
meant. in dicated the DAN designation meant that Mr. Gingerich had not purchased these dogs
from Steve Kruse. Finally, SS 1 dicated that many of the dogs were dirty and matted and that
the Golden Retrievers and all but three of the Samoyeds were groomed and bathed.

During the inspection, we identified 35 dogs using the APHIS 7006 disposition sheets and a microchip
reader. The other two dogs on our forms were the two that had tested positive for Heartworm disease

and had been euthanized yg) (2): (2) (YG)

On 25-August-2021, myself and VMO Autumn Unck conducted a Focused inspection at Daniel
Gingerich’s site #001. At the end of the inspection we were discussing the dogs that Daniel had hidden in
the barns on the property and had not presented for inspection. Autumn asked Daniel's employee, ii
if he had known the dogs were in the barn and he said “Yes, | knew the dogs were there, but

Daniel told me not to show the dogs to the USDA unless they specifically asked to see those buildings.
So, | didn’t show them to you as | was doing what my employer told me to do.”

then said that she and ad both told Daniel not to keep dogs in those barns
as it wasn't right and the dogs shouldn't be living like that. They both also stated that they were relieved
that Daniel was now having to get rid of all the dogs as he had just kept getting more and more and they
found it impossible to keep up.

Details of Search: on 28-July-2021, I joined IDALS inspectors at the
property to look at the dogs and their housing. Daniel arrived at the
location to walk us through. Daniel had told me that the building only
contained young dogs between the ages of 8 weeks and 6 months. Several older
dogs were found in the building and one dog appeared pregnant. I asked Daniel
where all the dogs came from and he said he had raised them all except for a
couple Dobermans that came from Wilbur Nisley who is a USDA licensed breeder.

The property consists of a large unfinished horse barn. The barn meets the
definition of outdoor housing and has large openings along the north, east
and south walls to allow entrance into the building. Approximately 150 dogs
are housed in the barn and consists of juveniles and adults of numerous
different breeds.

The dogs are housed in enclosures constructed of chain-link fencing and the
chain link is broken creating sharp points in at least one enclosure. The
dogs had also dug under the fencing of one enclosure and were seen passing
through this hole into the next enclosure.

Several enclosures are extremely over crowded containing approximately 25
dogs each.

The flooring of the enclosures is gravel and wood shavings. The sunlight is
unable to touch the floors and the gravel cannot be sanitized. Many of the
chain-link fence panels are sitting on wooden boards which are not sealed.
One enclosure has a wall constructed of unsealed wood.

21-05783_000780


## Daniel Gingerich 42-A-1632_page_779
The water provided to the dogs is no longer potable, but is dirty with
shavings floating in the water.

The temperature in the building was 92 degrees with a heat index of 109
degrees. Several of the older dogs appeared to be heat stressed.

There was no effective pest control program in place and there was an
enormous amount of flies present. In some parts of the enclosures, the
floors were covered with large black spots that ended up being a
concentration of flies.

One Cocker spaniel was seen pacing in circles. Daniel said it was blind that
was why it walked endlessly in circles. Daniel has no medical record for
this dog.

A small dead poodle was found outside of the south door to the barn. Daniel
said his employees had dropped a gate on it which killed it.

Areas of clutter are located near the dog enclosures and a drain is clogged
resulting in a large pool of water on the floor near the dog enclosures.

None of the enclosures have a shelter.

The dogs had no official ID and these dogs are not documented on APHIS form
7005.

Both myself and IDALS spoke with Daniel about what he needed to do with the
facility to become compliant. He asked if we could give him until August 15%
to fix the non-compliances in the building and i stated it would be up to my
management whether he could have until the August 15% or not. Daniel said he
intended to auction these dogs and others in January. I stated that no
regulated activity could be conducted from this location until it was
approved.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).

Female Shih tzu (tag #479) is showing signs of severe heat stress including open mouth breathing, high rate of
respiration, the tongue extending from the mouth beyond the teeth, and reddened skin. The dog was making a loud raspy
noise when she breathed and appeared to be gasping for breath. The dog is also expressing other behaviors indicating
she may be suffering from the ambient temperature such as laying sprawled across the floor and weak, unstable and
uncoordinated movements especially in her hind end. The dog was located in an outdoor shelter and had difficulty exiting
the shelter ultimately dragging her hind legs over the lip of the shelter entrance. Temperatures taken inside the shelter
ranged from 91 degrees F to 93 degrees F with a heat index of 107 degrees F to 109 degrees F. The facility
representative stated the dog had housed inside the sheltered building and moved to the outdoor enclosure that morning
and the dog had not been unstable or had difficulty with her hind legs before. The facility representative was not aware of

the dog's condition until the dog was found by the inspectors.

Heat stress could be detrimental to the health of the dog and can even result in death.

Female Cavalier spaniel (#492) has a large raw lesion on the inside of the right hind leg. The area is devoid of hair, is

wet, and appears inflammed and slightly reddened. Other areas of skin irritation are located along the inside of the left

leg with some hair loss and slight reddening of the skin. The hair around the affected areas is heavily matted, wet, tight to
the skin and has thick dark colored material trapped in it. Heavily matted hair is also located along the length of the
underside of the tail and has fresh and dried fecal material coating it. A greenish colored discharge is located on the
lower eyelids. Both wet and dry discharge is attached to the hair of the lower eyelids and a small amount is attached to
the interior section of the upper eyelids. Some straw was observed to be stuck in the discharge beneath the right eye.
The dog also has long rope-like mats attached to both ears and the mats are solid and coated with a dried grey material.

The facility representative was not aware of this dog's condition.

Abnormal skin and eye conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Matted hair could also cause discomfort

and pain and could also lead to further health issues.

Female Cocker Spaniel (tag #309) has poor ear health and a matted hair coat. The inside of the left ear is moderately
reddened, inflammed, and wet with a yellow liquid coating some of the ear's surfaces and attached from one surface to
another. The hair around the underside of the ear is wet with a dark brown material coating it. Long ropes of matted hair
are attached to the top of the dog's head and in front of the dog's left eye. The licensee was not aware of this dog's

condition.

Poor ear health could be painful to the dog and matted hair could also cause discomfort and pain to the animal as well as

lead to further health issues.

Female Pekingese (tag #460) has an abnormal skin condition and matted hair. Multiple lesions were identified across the

dog's back in front of the tail head. The areas are hairless, slightly reddened and wet. One affected area appeared as a

hole in the dog's back surrounded by heavily matted hair. The dog appeared sensitive and began to struggle only when
the affected areas were gently inspected. Excessively matted hair is located along the backside of both hindlegs and tail.
The hair is matted into large clumps. A large engorged tick is located on the dog's left ear and a small tick was located on
the right side of the muzzle. The facility representative did not know what the treatment plan is for ticks and was not

aware of the dog's condition.

Abnormal skin conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Matted hair could also cause discomfort and pain

and could also lead to further health issues. Ticks can transmit disease that can be detrimental to the health of the dog.

Female Cavalier spaniel (tag #444) has an abnormal condition of the skin and eyes. On both sides of the dog along the
top of the rib cage and back towards the hips are large hairless lesions. The lesions appear dark red in the center and
lighter red around their edges. A small amount of dark brown scab-like material is located on the surface of the lesions.
A hairless lesion is also on the surface of the right ear. The lesion is dark red in the center and lighter red along the
edges. A section of dark brown scab-like material is located in the center of the lesion. Another lesion was found on top
of the dog's head. The lesion is hairless, slightly reddened with scab-like material on the surface. Hair was seen in the
dog's mouth attached to the upper right cheek teeth along the gum line. When the hair was removed it revealed fresh
blood along the gum line. A greyish-white discharge is located on the lower eyelid of the left eye. Heavily matted hair is
located on the backside of the dog's hindlegs and contains a large clump of dark brown fecal material. The facility

representative is not aware of the condition of the dog.

Abnormal skin and eye conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Matted hair could also cause discomfort

and pain and could also lead to further health issues.

Inspection Report

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The above
mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective
treatment plan. The licensee must provide adequate veterinary care to the dogs at all times. The facility representative

had the dogs transported to a veterinarian at the time of the inspection.

Female Shiba Inu (tag #360) has excessively long toenails on all four feet. The toenails splayed out sideways when the
dog was standing on the flooring of the enclosure. The licensee and facility representative were unaware of the last time
the dog had her nails trimmed and were not aware that the toenails were overgrown. Excessively long toenails could

cause pain and discomfort as well as affect the dog's natural gait.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This dog must
have her toenails trimmed to an appropriate length and the licensee must ensure the plan to maintain properly trimmed

toenails is effective.

On June 2, 2021 the licensee had a prescription of Cephalexin and Rimadyl filled by the attending veterinarian for a dog
named "Misty". Instructions for the Cephalexin were to give 1 pill twice daily for 14 days with 28 pills prescribed. On the
day of the inspection, 23 Cephalexin pills were still remaining in the bottle. Instruction for the Rimadyl were to give 1 pill
twice daily for 14 days with 14 pills prescribed. On the day of the inspection, 14 pills Rimadyl! pills were still remaining in
the bottle. Failure to follow treatment plans and give medications as prescribed could interfere with the dog's ability to

recover from medical concerns and could lead to further health complications.

Inspection Report

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must fully and completely follow all treatment plans, including the giving of medications, at all times in order to ensure the

dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

The vaccines for the dogs are inappropriately stored. The temperature of the refrigerator containing the vaccines is 54
degrees F per the inspector's Kestrel. The following vaccines were found inside the refrigerator:

Numerous containers of NeoPar Parvo wirus vaccine which are to be stored between 35 to 45 degrees F.

Numerous containers of Zoetis Canine Distemper-Adenovirus Type 2-Parainfluenza-Parvovirus which are to be stored
between 35 to 45 degrees F.

Numerous containers of NeoVac Canine Distemper-Adenovirus Type 2 which are to be stored between 35 to 45 degrees
F.

Numerous containers of Nobivac Canine Distemper-Adenovirus Type 2-Parainfluenza-Parvovirus which are to be stored
between 35 to 46 degrees F.

Numerous containers of Nobivac Canine Distemper-Parvovirus which are to be stored between 35-45 degrees F.

Two containers of Nobivac Rabies vaccine which is to be stored between 35-46 degrees F.

Failure to store vaccines at appropriate temperatures may interfere with their effectiveness resulting in an increased risk

of disease.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee

must store all vaccines at the required temperatures to ensure that all dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Inspection Report

Time and method of identification.

Five adult large breed dogs do not have an official form of identification. The facility representative stated that he has the
metal tags and collars for the dogs, but has not yet placed them around the dogs' necks. The facility representative also
stated that the dogs have an ear tattoo, but when the inspectors looked at the tattoo it had faded and was no longer
legible. Failure to have official identification applied to each dog does not allow the inspectors to identify the dog and

could interfere in the ability to connect medical records and other documentation to the dog.

A class "A" dealer can identify all live dogs using the following methods: An official tag affixed to a collar around the dog's
neck, a microchip, or by a legible tattoo marking approved by the Administrator. The licensee must place collars with the

official metal tags around the necks of the five dogs and ensure that all dogs have proper identification at all times.

To be corrected by: July 16, 2021

2.50(a)(2)
Time and method of identification.

Cage cards are used as identification for every puppy. Throughout the facility numerous litters of weaned puppies are co-

mingled and in numerous unweaned litters contained foster puppies whith no relation to the female raising them.

One female Pomsky has a litter containing six puppies from three different dams. The DOB on the cage card is for her
puppy, but no DOB is documented on the cage card for the other puppies though it was thought by the facility
representative that the dates of birth for all the puppies were within 2 days of each other. There is also no identification
information for the female Pomsky on the cage card and no identifying information of the original dams and which puppy

belongs to which dam.

Inspection Report

The information provided by the cage cards did not allow the inspectors to determine which puppies belonged to the adult
female residing in the enclosure and which additional adult females were dams tothe other puppies. An incomplete cage

card does not meet the requirements for identification.

A class "A" dealer must identify all dogs under 16 weeks old by the use of an official tag, a distinctive and legible tattoo, or
a plastic-type collar containing the required information. APHIS Officials also accept microchips or written identification
attached to the enclosure (cage cards) for puppies under 16 weeks old provided that these puppies are maintained in
distinct litters and provided that the cage card contains all of the required information. The consistent movement of
puppies from one mother to another does not constitute maintenance of puppies in distinct litters and failure to individually

identify puppies prevents APHIS Officials from tracking animals movement either in the facility or following sale.

The licensee must ensure that each animal's identity is known with certainty by appropriate individual identification or by
maintaining puppies less than 16 weeks old in distinct groups that are not co-mingled and using appropriate cage cards

with all required information.

On June 14, 2021, the licensee gave ownership of approximately 150 dogs to another individual. No disposition forms for

these dogs were provided to the inspector.

Failure to provide disposition information does not allow APHIS officials to trace animals to premises where they have

resided or are currently located and can interfere with the ability to properly identify dogs.

Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose all required information
concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or
her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of. The records shall include any offspring

The Program of Veterinary Care could not be located for review by the inspectors. During the inspection, one dog was

preventing ticks and the plan could not be reviewed due to the missing Program of Veterinary Care. Multiple dogs were
identified with heavily matted hair coats and one dog was identified with severely overgrown toenails, but the plans to
maintain healthy and unmatted hair coats and properly trimmed toenails are located in the Program of Veterinary Care, so
could not be reviewed. Failure to provide the Program of Veterinary Care to the inspectors for review does not ensure the

dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care which could have a negative impact on their health and well-being.

The Exercise Plan for Dogs could not be located for review by the inspectors. Failure to provide the written exercise plan
for review does not allow the inspectors to ensure the dogs are receiving the appropriate exercise which could cause their

health and well-being to suffer.

Each dealer shall allow APHIS officials to examine records required to be kept by the Act and the regulations. The

licensee must provide the Program of Veterinary Care and the Exercise Plan for Dogs for review during the inspection in

Female Shih tzu (tag #479) is showing signs of severe heat distress. The dog was found inside a shelter located in an
outdoor enclosure. The inspector could hear a rasping sound coming from the shelter as she approached it. Upon
opening the shelter door the inspector observed the dog lying on the floor of the shelter creating a loud raspy sound as
she appeared to gasp for breath. The dog is performing wide open mouth breathing with an extremely high respiration
rate and her tongue is extending out of her mouth beyond the teeth. The dog had recently been shaved and her skin
appeared to have a reddened tint. The dog moved about the shelter, but appeared unstable and continuously laid
sprawled on the floor with her legs stretched out. To exit the shelter, the dog is required to step over a lip at the shelter
entrance and the inspectors observed her having difficulty getting over the lip and finally succeeded in exiting the shelter
by dragging her hind legs across it. The dog continued to appear unstable and had difficulty keeping her hind legs from

collapsing. The facility representative stated the dog had never had problems with her hind legs.

The dog was moved to an enclosure inside the Whelping Building next to an open door with a breeze. The dog still
appeared unstable and had some difficulty moving around the enclosure and needed slight assistance from the facility
representative to locate the water receptacle, whereupon, she immediately began to drink. The dog drank water multiple
times as the inspectors watched. The dog continued to have an extremely high respiration rate along with open mouth

breathing and lying sprawled on the enclosure floor.

Inspection Report

The inspectors observed the dog again approximately an hour after she had been moved to the Whelping Building, and

she still appeared slightly weak and unstable.

The facility representative stated that the dog is normally housed inside the sheltered housing building, but had been
moved to the outdoor enclosure that morning. The temperature directly inside the shelter door was between 91 degrees

F and 93 degrees F with a heat index between 107 degrees F and 109 degrees F according to the inspector's Kestrel.

Housing dogs in temperatures and humidity that are inappropriate could result in the discomfort, suffering, and even

death.

When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to
alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity,
and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal's age,
species, breed, overall health status, and acclimation. The licensee must ensure that all dogs are housed in climatic

conditions that are appropriate to maintain their comfort and well-being at all times.

To be corrected by: At the time of the inspection the facility representative moved the dog to a more appropriate location
and then transported her to a veterinarian.

facility representative explained that the dog, a mini Australian Shepherd, had crawled under the fence through one of the
gaps between two adjacent enclosures, and when it entered the adjacent enclosure, it was attacked and killed by the

dogs housed there.

Within the sheltered housing building there is one enclosure, containing an adult female dog and her seven puppies, that
has an opening cut in the fencing that will accommodate a self-feeder. The opening is located along the floor and did not
contain a self-feeder at the time of the inspection. The opening is large enough to allow a puppy to escape from the

enclosure.

A section of the metal fencing between two enclosures, containing a total of two adult dogs and three puppies, in the
covered outdoor enclosures is not secured and is easily moved. One of the adjacent gates is secured with wire, but the

resulting gap is large enough that the dogs could put their head or leg through.

Thirteen enclosures in the whelping building, housing approximately 8 adult female dogs and 97 puppies, have carabiner

style clips to secure entrance to the enclosure. These clips do not secure the entrance tightly and leave a gap large

enough for the puppies to put their heads and legs through.

Carpet squares used as bedding in three enclosures containing 3 adult dogs and approximately 15 unweaned puppies,

have long strands of the material that have pulled away and pose a choking threat to puppies.

The storage closet in the sheltered facility has a leaking water pipe. There is alarge amount of water-soaked bedding

during an earlier visit to the facility, but the facility representative stated he had not had time to fix the water pipe.

Facilities that are not structurally sound, in good repair, or properly maintained pose a risk to the animals they are to
house and protect. When the enclosure fails to contain the animals, this can result in injury, inability to access food and

water, and in the case described above, death.

Facilities, enclosures, and their contents must be good repair. Housing facilities for dogs must protect the animals from
injuries and contain the animals securely. The licensee must alter the enclosures in a manner that removes the openings
and gaps and eliminates the ability of the animals to escape. The licensee must also repair the leaking water pipe.

The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the animals and contain them securely at all times.

3.1(b)

Housing facilities, general.

There is an approximately 3’ x 6’ closet located in the sheltered building were the dams and unweaned puppies are
housed. The closet is full of a variety of whelping beds, boxes, bags, buckets, pales, screens, and other unused items to
the point you cannot enter the closet much further than the doorway. The closet also has a leaking water pipe near the

door with large pile of soaked wood shaving bedding material that has been put down to absorb some of the water.

Housing areas must be free of areas that are cluttered or inaccessible and where pests and other vermin could take up
residence. Inaccessible areas cannot be cleaned or evaluated for structural problems. This is particularly troublesome
when there is a visible problem like a water leak that could be causing further problems in adjacent areas that cannot be

evaluated due to the clutter.

Numerous sharp points are located throughout the facility.

Inside the sheltered building there is one enclosure, containing one adult dog and four puppies, which has the metal
feeder attached to the front gate by a piece of wire. The sharp ends of the wire are protruding into the enclosure and

could come into direct contact with the dog every time it approaches the feeder to access the food.

In one covered outdoor enclosure, containing four dogs, the shelter has no door, but the metal door frame is still attached
to the entrance. The door frame is broken creating a sharp point at the level of the dogs. In another covered outdoor
enclosure, containing five dogs, the shelter has at least five screws protruding from the entrance which the dogs could

come in contact with.

In one outdoor enclosure, containing eight dogs, there is a long strand of loose wire lying on the ground along with a

broken metal fence post. One dog was seen running through the loose wire.

In the corner of an outdoor enclosure, containing nine dogs, there is a broken piece of chain link creating a sharp point at

the level of the animals.

In another outdoor enclosure, containing twelve large breed dogs, numerous sharp points due to broken wires are located
along the bottom of the fencing. The sharp ends of metal screws are protruding into the shelter through the hinges used

to attach the door to the shelter. These sharp screws are located at the level of the dogs.

Sharp points could cause injury to the dogs.

Approximately 7 covered outdoor enclosures, containing approximately 25 adult dogs, have plastic buckets for water that

are chewed around the top edges to the point where they can no longer be properly cleaned or sanitized.

In one outdoor enclosure, containing approximately 12 dogs, the top edges of the water buckets have a thick buildup of

hair and dirt.

Routine cleaning and sanitizing of food and water receptacles and other surfaces is important to keep contamination with
dirt and debris that could contain fecal material or other disease-causing bacteria, viruses, or parasites to a minimum.
Chewed plastic receptacles contain rough edges, small dents and pockets that cannot be adequately cleaned and may

continue to harbor these disease-causing agents.

The drains for the sheltered housing building and the covered outdoor runs transports waste directly outside the building's
exterior walls. The drain on the northwest corner has created a large, thick pile of wet fecal and food waste, hair, and
straw. The wet pile has built-up against the lower portion of the exterior wall and has attracted a large number of flies.

APHIS officials had identified the problem on an earlier visit, but the facility has not taken any corrective measures.

The drain on the southwest corner of the sheltered building dumps into PVC pipes that lay on top of the ground and
transports the waste down a hill and away from the building. The PVC pipes run parallel to one outdoor enclosure that
contains eight adult dogs. A stream of liquid waste containing material that is dark green and black is flowing through a
section of the outdoor enclosure. Wet, mossy material is located between the drain pipe and the fence of the enclosure.

The drain pipe could not be checked for damage as the vegetation is overgrown and has hidden most of the pipe.

Drains and drainage areas that are not properly maintained could result in a buildup of waste that could attract pests,

create odors, soil animals, and increase the risk of disease hazards.

Disposal and drainage systems must minimize vermin and pest infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. All
drains must be properly constructed, installed, and maintained. The licensee must alter the drains in a manner that
moves the pile of waste away from the exterior of the building and eliminates the stream of waste flowing through the dog

enclosure. The licensee must ensure that all drains are working properly at all times.

During the inspection, the inspectors identified a decomposing dog that had been killed in a fight. The dog's body was
placed outside of the enclosure, but just a few feet away from the fence. Decomposing animals could attract pests such

as flies, create odors and increase the risk of disease.

Housing facility operators must provide for regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food
wastes, bedding, debris, garbage, water, other fluids and wastes, and dead animals, in a manner that minimizes
contamination and disease risks. The licensee must remove the dead dog and ensure that all waste, including dead

animals, are removed from the areas housing dogs as quickly as possible.

In the Whelping Building the trash can is missing the lid and a large pile of empty sacks is placed in a corner. Exposed

trash could attract pests such as flies and mice which could have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.

Trash containers in housing facilities and in food storage and food preparation areas must be leakproof and must have
tightly fitted lids on them at all times. The facility representative replaced the lid to the trash can at the time of the
inspection, but the license must ensure that all trash is collected as quickly as possible and placed in leak -proof

containers bearing tightly fitted lids.

Primary enclosures.

The whelping building has 57 enclosures that each include a whelping box in the back half of the enclosure and slatted
flooring enclosed by wire fencing in the front half. The floor slats are approximately 3 to 4 inches wide, but the gaps
between them are wide enough that the legs of puppies will easily and frequently fall through them. The inspectors
observed puppies in numerous enclosures and witnessed the legs of one or more of the puppies fall through the

openings.

During the inspection an adult Shih tzu was moved into the building and the inspectors observed her legs fall through the

gaps in the flooring.

APHIS officials had identified this issue to the licensee and facility representative at earlier visits to the facility, but no

action has been taken to correct the problem.

To prevent injuries to legs and feet, puppies need a safe stable surface to move and learn to walk on. To protect them

from injury, all dogs require a safe floor surfaces that will not allow their legs to pass through.

Primary enclosures must have floors constructed in a manner that does not allow the dogs' feet to pass through any
openings in the floor. The licensee must alter the floors in a manner that will not allow the feet of the dogs to pass

through. The licensee must ensure that all flooring is safe for the dogs at all times.

dirt.

In the whelping building, two enclosures with 2 dams and approximately 12 unweaned puppies, have a dry brownish
material smeared on some of the vertical surfaces of the whelping boxes which appears to be caused by the dogs
jumping up and putting dirty, feces covered paws against the walls. One enclosure had a similar brownish crusty material

In the large Whelping building, the whelping boxes contain wood shavings as absorbent material. In two whelping boxes,
accessed by a total of fifteen puppies, the shavings were completely saturated with urine and feces with no clean,
absorbent areas left. The puppies were observed running around in the wet, dirty shavings. The facility representative

stated that the shavings are only cleaned out of the boxes and replaced once a day.

Bedding material contaminated by waste, mold, dirt and insects may cause the animals to become wet and soiled as well

as raise the risk of disease hazards.

Pens, runs, and outdoor housing areas using material that cannot be sanitized using the methods provided in the

There is a buildup of dirt, dust and cobwebs along the back wall of the covered outdoor enclosures and on the retaining
walls and ledges of the exterior wall. The buildup of dust, dirt and cobwebs can increase the risk of disease hazards

towards the dogs.

Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds must be kept clean. The
licensee must remove the buildup of dirt, dust, and cobwebs from the walls and ledges of the covered outdoor enclosures

and ensure the building and surrounding areas remain clean.

The vegetation around the sheltered building is excessively overgrown. The vegetation is growing up against the exterior
walls and it is interfering in the ability of waste to flow from the drains and away from the building. The vegetation is also
covering the building's drainage pipe which lies on top of the ground and it cannot be determined if the pipe is damaged
and leaking as the pipe cannot be visualized. Overgrown vegetation can attract pests such as flies and mice, as well as

make it difficult to view areas of the facility for damage and interfere with cleaning processes.

Weeds, grasses, and bushes must be controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control, and to

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

An excessively large number of flies and insects are located throughout the facility. The interiors of the sheltered building
and whelping building, containing approximately 71 adult dogs and 370 puppies, are kept cool by leaving the doors open.
The doors have no screens and flies and other insects are free to enter the buildings. Flies were seen on the walls of the
buildings and enclosures, in the water bowls, in the food bowls and on the dog food, on the floors of the enclosures, and
on the dogs themselves. In the outdoor enclosures flies were inside some of the shelters, accessed by a total of 17 dogs,
along with gnat-like insects and ant-like insects that had infested the straw bedding. The facility representative stated
that they spray for flies inside the buildings. Excessive numbers of flies and other insects can contaminate food and water

as well as cause health hazards towards the dogs.

An effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs and cats, and birds and mammals that
are pests, must be established and maintained. The licensee must establish an effective plan to control flies and other
insects in order to support the health of the dogs. The licensee must ensure the plan is effective at all times.

done for the dog. The documents did not contain the dog's identity, breed, sex, age, or tag number. Failure to provide
information concerning the identity of the animal on medical records does not allow APHIS officials to determine which
dog the medical record belongs to and interferes in the inspector's ability to determine if the animal has received adequate

veterinary care.

Each dealer shall make and keep medical records for dogs that include the identity of the animal, including identifying
marks, tattoos, or tags on the animal and the animal’s breed, sex, and age. The licensee must ensure that all medical
records contain the identification of the dog in order to allow APHIS officials to determine if a specific dog has received

adequate veterinary care.

To be corrected by: From this day forward all medical records must contain the dog's identification.

Veterinary care for dogs.

During a prior visit conducted by APHIS officials, nine dogs were identified that required veterinary care. At the time of
the current inspection, the inspectors requested the written medical records for these dogs, but the facility has no written
medical records concerning the examination, diagnosis and treatment plans for these animals. Failure to maintain

medical records does not allow APHIS officials to ensure the animals have received adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer shall maintain medical records that include the problem identified, the date and description of the problem,
examination findings, test results, plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed. The licensee must
document in writing all required information for any dog with a medical concern in order for the inspectors to determine the

animal has received adequate veterinary care.

3.15(a)(9)
Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.

The facility has five adult dogs contained in three transport enclosures waiting to be taken to another location. There is no
absorbent litter in any of the three transport enclosures and feces and spilled dog food are located on the floor of one of
these enclosures. The inspectors first observed these dogs at approximately 9am and the facility representative stated
the dogs had been in the transport enclosures since 7am. The inspectors left the facility at approximately 3pm and two
dogs still remained in transport enclosures with no absorbent litterand feces and spilled dog food are located on the floor
of one of the enclosures. Failure to provide clean, absorbent litter may cause the dogs to become contaminated by waste

material.

Primary enclosures used to transport dogs must contain enough unused litter to absorb and cover excreta. The litter must
be of a suitably absorbent material that is safe and nontoxic to the dogs. The licensee must add absorbent litter to all

enclosures used to transport dogs in order to ensure the dogs remain clean and dry.

To be corrected by: From this day forward absorbent litter must be used when transporting dogs.

3.15(e)
Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.

Five adult dogs are contained in three transport crates waiting to be moved to another location. Two plastic crates each
contain two dogs and the amount of space is insufficient to allow the dogs to turn around and lie in normal positions. The
inspectors observed one dog turning around in an abnormal position due to the lack of space. The dog was required to
lower his hind end towards the floor in order to bend his front end around to complete the turn in the tight quarters.

Failure to provide adequate space during transport may have a negative impact on the animal's health and well-being.

Inspection Report

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats must be large enough to ensure that each animal contained in
the primary enclosure has enough space to turn about normally while standing, to stand and sit erect, and tolie in a
natural position. The licensee must ensure that transport enclosures provide the required amount of space for each dog

in order to support their health and well-being.

To be corrected by: The facility representative returned the dogs to their primary housing enclosures or separated the
dogs into compliant transport enclosures at the time of the inspection.
3.19(e)(1)

Terminal facilities.

Five dogs are contained in transport enclosures waiting to be moved to another location. The enclosures are sitting in
front of the kennel along the driveway and are provided with no shade to protect them from direct sunlight. Two of the
transport enclosures are constructed of plastic with a solid top, but one of the transport enclosures is a wire crate with no
solid top. The inspectors requested the facility representative to provide the dogs with shade which was done. Failure to
provide protection from the direct rays of the sun could cause the dogs to become overheated which could have a

detrimental impact on their health and well-being.

Shade must be provided that is sufficient to protect the dog from the direct rays of the sun. The licensee must ensure that

all dogs housed in transport enclosures have sufficient shade as protection from the direct rays of the sun in order to

support their health and well-being.

To be corrected by: The facility representative provided shade to the dogs at the time of the inspection.

Summary:

Animal Care has documented a critical noncompliance for Daniel Gingerich’s
(GINGERICH) refusal to allow Animal Care employees to conduct a routine,
unannounced inspection at his facility. GINGERICH is licensed as a Class “A” breeder
under the Animal Welfare Act (AWA).

Background Information:

On June 14, 2021, Kelly Maxwell (MAXWELL) and William Janecke, inspectors
for Animal Care, attempted to conduct an unannounced inspection at a site believed to be
owned by GINGERICH in response to a public complaint (AC21-287). Dixie Erdman
(ERDMAN), a representative of the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land

Stewardship (IDALS) was also present. Upon the inspectors arrival at the cite

told MAXWELL the dogs belonged to GINGERICH. GINGERICH stated he was the
owner of some of the dogs and that {IE wed some of the dogs. MAXWELL

informed GINGERICH that he needed to allow an inspection or it would be considered a
refusal. After MAXWELL explained the potential repercussions for refusing an

inspection, GINGERICH stated, “Just cite me for refusing”. GINGE

dogs. Afte RS | «batty “received” the dogs from GINGERICH, (O) (6), (©) (1G)

allowed the inspection team access to the dogs to check on (oy to) NC) well-being.
MAXWELL requested an application package be mailed to o that

ould apply for a license. MAXWELL informed him that no regulated
activity could be conducted without a license.

ERDMAN provided addresses of two other facilities that were reported to be
owned and/or operated by GINGERICH. Upon arrival to the first of those sites,
inspectors met with (b) (6), (0) (7(C) AS indicated that she did not know where
the dogs came from or to whom they were sold. As per MAXWELL’S memo, she
believes may have been contacted by GINGERICH prior to the visit.

When inspectors arrived at the last ‘i TS found to be present

site tb) (6), (0) (ON

formed the inspectors the dogs had been on the property since
January, but he had been given ownership today. This further raised real

collusion or interference of the inspection process by GINGERICH. tb) (8). (0) (NC)
allowed the inspectors access to check on the health and well-being of the dogs. Again,
MAXWELL reiterated that OXON YC could not be conducted at the site until a

license was received and told he would be receiving an application
package in the mail.

GINGERICH informed MAXWELL during the March 03, 2021, Courtesy Visit,
that he would be housing dogs at other locations. During that visit and in several
subsequent follow up discussions, MAXWELL told GINGERICH additional sites would
need to be added to his license and approved for use, before regulated activity could be
conducted from those sites. GINGERICH would not provide any additional information
on where the sites were located or when they would be ready for inspection.
GINGERICH made it clear that he was going to continue breeding dogs at sites that had
not been approved. He did not know whether puppies would be whelped at those sites.

On April 07, 2021, MAXWELL conducted an inspection at GINGERICH’S
facility in which she cited him for the sale of puppies that were not born on his property.
This demonstrated the need for a Class B license. Further, MAXWELL cited
GINGERICH for the lack of acquisition information on more than 500 puppies and the
lack of both acquisition and disposition information on a list of adult dogs and their
whelped litters, 364 puppies having no transport information, and the destruction of
acquisition information on more than 500 puppies.

Concerns and scope:

Animal Care’s ability to conduct unannounced inspections at all sites housing
regulated species is a critical component of its mission in ensuring the welfare of animals
regulated under the AWA.!' The refusal to allow an inspection is a serious allegation as

1 1 Sec. 2.126 Access and inspection of records and property.

it obstructs Animal Care’s ability to assess the welfare of animals and the compliance of
regulated entities and is of great concern. Animal Care requests IES substantiate this
alleged violation. In addition, Animal Care requests that IES investigate the relationship
between GINGERICH and the property owners at the unapproved sites, including at what
point ownership may have changed hands, whether or not the exchange of ownership
actually occurred, the business model used, and the length of time regulated activity has
been conducted at the sites. Animal Care also requests that IES determine if
GINGERICH made any false or fraudulent statements to any government officials.
Animal Care believes GINGERICH is intentionally interfering with the inspection
process, utilizine GPs pawns in his effort to
deceive Animal Care, and avoiding making all animals and facilities used for regulated
activities available for inspection. Animal Care requests this investigation be focused on
substantiating these alleged violations to support potential administrative enforcement
action.

If unrelated but additional information is discovered during this investigation that could
substantiate a noncompliance with the Animal Welfare Act and its Regulations, notify the
program point of contact to discuss next appropriate steps.

respiration, the tongue extending from the mouth beyond the teeth, and reddened skin. The dog was making a loud raspy
noise when she breathed and appeared to be gasping for breath. The dog is also expressing other behaviors indicating
she may be suffering from the ambient temperature such as laying sprawled across the floor and weak, unstable and
uncoordinated movements especially in her hind end. The dog was located in an outdoor shelter and had difficulty exiting
the shelter ultimately dragging her hind legs over the lip of the shelter entrance. Temperatures taken inside the shelter
ranged from 91 degrees F to 93 degrees F with a heat index of 107 degrees F to 109 degrees F. The facility
representative stated the dog had housed inside the sheltered building and moved to the outdoor enclosure that morning
and the dog had not been unstable or had difficulty with her hind legs before. The facility representative was not aware of

the dog's condition until the dog was found by the inspectors.

Heat stress could be detrimental to the health of the dog and can even result in death.

Female Cavalier spaniel (#492) has a large raw lesion on the inside of the right hind leg. The area is devoid of hair, is

the skin and has thick dark colored material trapped in it. Heavily matted hair is also located along the length of the
underside of the tail and has fresh and dried fecal material coating it. A greenish colored discharge is located on the
lower eyelids. Both wet and dry discharge is attached to the hair of the lower eyelids and a small amount is attached to
the interior section of the upper eyelids. Some straw was observed to be stuck in the discharge beneath the right eye.
The dog also has long rope-like mats attached to both ears and the mats are solid and coated with a dried grey material.

The facility representative was not aware of this dog's condition.

Abnormal skin and eye conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Matted hair could also cause discomfort

and pain and could also lead to further health issues.

Female Cocker Spaniel (tag #309) has poor ear health and a matted hair coat. The inside of the left ear is moderately
reddened, inflammed, and wet with a yellow liquid coating some of the ear's surfaces and attached from one surface to
another. The hair around the underside of the ear is wet with a dark brown material coating it. Long ropes of matted hair
are attached to the top of the dog's head and in front of the dog's left eye. The licensee was not aware of this dog's

Female Cavalier spaniel (tag #444) has an abnormal condition of the skin and eyes. On both sides of the dog along the
top of the rib cage and back towards the hips are large hairless lesions. The lesions appear dark red in the center and
lighter red around their edges. A small amount of dark brown scab-like material is located on the surface of the lesions.
A hairless lesion is also on the surface of the right ear. The lesion is dark red in the center and lighter red along the
edges. A section of dark brown scab-like material is located in the center of the lesion. Another lesion was found on top
of the dog's head. The lesion is hairless, slightly reddened with scab-like material on the surface. Hair was seen in the
dog's mouth attached to the upper right cheek teeth along the gum line. When the hair was removed it revealed fresh
blood along the gum line. A greyish-white discharge is located on the lower eyelid of the left eye. Heavily matted hair is
located on the backside of the dog's hindlegs and contains a large clump of dark brown fecal material. The facility

representative is not aware of the condition of the dog.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The above
mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective
treatment plan. The licensee must provide adequate veterinary care to the dogs at all times. The facility representative

had the dogs transported to a veterinarian at the time of the inspection.

Female Shiba Inu (tag #360) has excessively long toenails on all four feet. The toenails splayed out sideways when the
dog was standing on the flooring of the enclosure. The licensee and facility representative were unaware of the last time
the dog had her nails trimmed and were not aware that the toenails were overgrown. Excessively long toenails could

cause pain and discomfort as well as affect the dog's natural gait.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This dog must
have her toenails trimmed to an appropriate length and the licensee must ensure the plan to maintain properly trimmed

toenails is effective.

On June 2, 2021 the licensee had a prescription of Cephalexin and Rimadyl filled by the attending veterinarian for a dog
named "Misty". Instructions for the Cephalexin were to give 1 pill twice daily for 14 days with 28 pills prescribed. On the
day of the inspection, 23 Cephalexin pills were still remaining in the bottle. Instruction for the Rimadyl were to give 1 pill
twice daily for 14 days with 14 pills prescribed. On the day of the inspection, 14 pills Rimadyl! pills were still remaining in
the bottle. Failure to follow treatment plans and give medications as prescribed could interfere with the dog's ability to

recover from medical concerns and could lead to further health complications.

Time and method of identification.

Five adult large breed dogs do not have an official form of identification. The facility representative stated that he has the
metal tags and collars for the dogs, but has not yet placed them around the dogs' necks. The facility representative also
stated that the dogs have an ear tattoo, but when the inspectors looked at the tattoo it had faded and was no longer
legible. Failure to have official identification applied to each dog does not allow the inspectors to identify the dog and

could interfere in the ability to connect medical records and other documentation to the dog.

A class "A" dealer can identify all live dogs using the following methods: An official tag affixed to a collar around the dog's
neck, a microchip, or by a legible tattoo marking approved by the Administrator. The licensee must place collars with the

official metal tags around the necks of the five dogs and ensure that all dogs have proper identification at all times.

One female Pomsky has a litter containing six puppies from three different dams. The DOB on the cage card is for her
puppy, but no DOB is documented on the cage card for the other puppies though it was thought by the facility
representative that the dates of birth for all the puppies were within 2 days of each other. There is also no identification
information for the female Pomsky on the cage card and no identifying information of the original dams and which puppy

belongs to which dam.

Inspection Report

The information provided by the cage cards did not allow the inspectors to determine which puppies belonged to the adult
female residing in the enclosure and which additional adult females were dams tothe other puppies. An incomplete cage

card does not meet the requirements for identification.

A class "A" dealer must identify all dogs under 16 weeks old by the use of an official tag, a distinctive and legible tattoo, or
a plastic-type collar containing the required information. APHIS Officials also accept microchips or written identification
attached to the enclosure (cage cards) for puppies under 16 weeks old provided that these puppies are maintained in
distinct litters and provided that the cage card contains all of the required information. The consistent movement of
puppies from one mother to another does not constitute maintenance of puppies in distinct litters and failure to individually

identify puppies prevents APHIS Officials from tracking animals movement either in the facility or following sale.

The licensee must ensure that each animal's identity is known with certainty by appropriate individual identification or by
maintaining puppies less than 16 weeks old in distinct groups that are not co-mingled and using appropriate cage cards

with all required information.

Female Shih tzu (tag #479) is showing signs of severe heat distress. The dog was found inside a shelter located in an
outdoor enclosure. The inspector could hear a rasping sound coming from the shelter as she approached it. Upon
opening the shelter door the inspector observed the dog lying on the floor of the shelter creating a loud raspy sound as
she appeared to gasp for breath. The dog is performing wide open mouth breathing with an extremely high respiration
rate and her tongue is extending out of her mouth beyond the teeth. The dog had recently been shaved and her skin
appeared to have a reddened tint. The dog moved about the shelter, but appeared unstable and continuously laid
sprawled on the floor with her legs stretched out. To exit the shelter, the dog is required to step over a lip at the shelter
entrance and the inspectors observed her having difficulty getting over the lip and finally succeeded in exiting the shelter
by dragging her hind legs across it. The dog continued to appear unstable and had difficulty keeping her hind legs from

collapsing. The facility representative stated the dog had never had problems with her hind legs.

The dog was moved to an enclosure inside the Whelping Building next to an open door with a breeze. The dog still
appeared unstable and had some difficulty moving around the enclosure and needed slight assistance from the facility
representative to locate the water receptacle, whereupon, she immediately began to drink. The dog drank water multiple
times as the inspectors watched. The dog continued to have an extremely high respiration rate along with open mouth

breathing and lying sprawled on the enclosure floor.

Inspection Report

The inspectors observed the dog again approximately an hour after she had been moved to the Whelping Building, and

she still appeared slightly weak and unstable.

The facility representative stated that the dog is normally housed inside the sheltered housing building, but had been
moved to the outdoor enclosure that morning. The temperature directly inside the shelter door was between 91 degrees

F and 93 degrees F with a heat index between 107 degrees F and 109 degrees F according to the inspector's Kestrel.

Housing dogs in temperatures and humidity that are inappropriate could result in the discomfort, suffering, and even

death.

When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to
alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity,
and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal's age,
species, breed, overall health status, and acclimation. The licensee must ensure that all dogs are housed in climatic

conditions that are appropriate to maintain their comfort and well-being at all times.

boards, wire, or concrete blocks. The decaying carcass of a dead dog was found outside one these enclosures. The
facility representative explained that the dog, a mini Australian Shepherd, had crawled under the fence through one of the
gaps between two adjacent enclosures, and when it entered the adjacent enclosure, it was attacked and killed by the

dogs housed there.

Within the sheltered housing building there is one enclosure, containing an adult female dog and her seven puppies, that
has an opening cut in the fencing that will accommodate a self-feeder. The opening is located along the floor and did not
contain a self-feeder at the time of the inspection. The opening is large enough to allow a puppy to escape from the

enclosure.

A section of the metal fencing between two enclosures, containing a total of two adult dogs and three puppies, in the
covered outdoor enclosures is not secured and is easily moved. One of the adjacent gates is secured with wire, but the

resulting gap is large enough that the dogs could put their head or leg through.

Thirteen enclosures in the whelping building, housing approximately 8 adult female dogs and 97 puppies, have carabiner

style clips to secure entrance to the enclosure. These clips do not secure the entrance tightly and leave a gap large

enough for the puppies to put their heads and legs through.

Carpet squares used as bedding in three enclosures containing 3 adult dogs and approximately 15 unweaned puppies,

have long strands of the material that have pulled away and pose a choking threat to puppies.

material on the floor that has been used to try to adsorb some of the standing water. APHIS officials identified this issue

during an earlier visit to the facility, but the facility representative stated he had not had time to fix the water pipe.

Facilities that are not structurally sound, in good repair, or properly maintained pose a risk to the animals they are to
house and protect. When the enclosure fails to contain the animals, this can result in injury, inability to access food and

water, and in the case described above, death.

Facilities, enclosures, and their contents must be good repair. Housing facilities for dogs must protect the animals from
injuries and contain the animals securely. The licensee must alter the enclosures in a manner that removes the openings
and gaps and eliminates the ability of the animals to escape. The licensee must also repair the leaking water pipe.

The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the animals and contain them securely at all times.

3.1(b)

Housing facilities, general.

There is an approximately 3’ x 6’ closet located in the sheltered building were the dams and unweaned puppies are
housed. The closet is full of a variety of whelping beds, boxes, bags, buckets, pales, screens, and other unused items to
the point you cannot enter the closet much further than the doorway. The closet also has a leaking water pipe near the

door with large pile of soaked wood shaving bedding material that has been put down to absorb some of the water.

Housing areas must be free of areas that are cluttered or inaccessible and where pests and other vermin could take up
residence. Inaccessible areas cannot be cleaned or evaluated for structural problems. This is particularly troublesome
when there is a visible problem like a water leak that could be causing further problems in adjacent areas that cannot be

evaluated due to the clutter.

Inspection Report

Approximately 7 covered outdoor enclosures, containing approximately 25 adult dogs, have plastic buckets for water that

are chewed around the top edges to the point where they can no longer be properly cleaned or sanitized.

In one outdoor enclosure, containing approximately 12 dogs, the top edges of the water buckets have a thick buildup of

hair and dirt.

Routine cleaning and sanitizing of food and water receptacles and other surfaces is important to keep contamination with
dirt and debris that could contain fecal material or other disease-causing bacteria, viruses, or parasites to a minimum.
Chewed plastic receptacles contain rough edges, small dents and pockets that cannot be adequately cleaned and may

continue to harbor these disease-causing agents.

All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. The licensee must repair, replace, or alter the damaged and dirty
water buckets in a manner that allows them to be readily cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must ensure all surfaces

are maintained in good repair at all times.

Housing facilities, general.

The drains for the sheltered housing building and the covered outdoor runs transports waste directly outside the building's
exterior walls. The drain on the northwest corner has created a large, thick pile of wet fecal and food waste, hair, and
straw. The wet pile has built-up against the lower portion of the exterior wall and has attracted a large number of flies.

APHIS officials had identified the problem on an earlier visit, but the facility has not taken any corrective measures.

The drain on the southwest corner of the sheltered building dumps into PVC pipes that lay on top of the ground and
transports the waste down a hill and away from the building. The PVC pipes run parallel to one outdoor enclosure that
contains eight adult dogs. A stream of liquid waste containing material that is dark green and black is flowing through a
section of the outdoor enclosure. Wet, mossy material is located between the drain pipe and the fence of the enclosure.

The drain pipe could not be checked for damage as the vegetation is overgrown and has hidden most of the pipe.

Drains and drainage areas that are not properly maintained could result in a buildup of waste that could attract pests,

create odors, soil animals, and increase the risk of disease hazards.

Disposal and drainage systems must minimize vermin and pest infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. All
drains must be properly constructed, installed, and maintained. The licensee must alter the drains in a manner that
moves the pile of waste away from the exterior of the building and eliminates the stream of waste flowing through the dog

enclosure. The licensee must ensure that all drains are working properly at all times.

During the inspection, the inspectors identified a decomposing dog that had been killed in a fight. The dog's body was
placed outside of the enclosure, but just a few feet away from the fence. Decomposing animals could attract pests such

as flies, create odors and increase the risk of disease.

Housing facility operators must provide for regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food
wastes, bedding, debris, garbage, water, other fluids and wastes, and dead animals, in a manner that minimizes
contamination and disease risks. The licensee must remove the dead dog and ensure that all waste, including dead

animals, are removed from the areas housing dogs as quickly as possible.

In the Whelping Building the trash can is missing the lid and a large pile of empty sacks is placed in a corner. Exposed

trash could attract pests such as flies and mice which could have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.

Trash containers in housing facilities and in food storage and food preparation areas must be leakproof and must have
tightly fitted lids on them at all times. The facility representative replaced the lid to the trash can at the time of the
inspection, but the license must ensure that all trash is collected as quickly as possible and placed in leak -proof

containers bearing tightly fitted lids.

Sheltered housing facilities.

An enclosure in the sheltered housing building, containing a female Wheaton Terrier and her 6 unweaned puppies, has a
section of the wall where the construction of the enclosure is unfinished. The area is in the back wall. The walls of the
rest of enclosure are covered with tile, except this approximately 18” by 24” area where it looks like a door to the outside

was planned. The unfinished area has exposed 2’ x 4” wood framing and pieces of fiberglass insulation.

Surfaces of enclosures that have potential contact with dogs must be cleanable and sanitizable in order to prevent the
buildup of debris and other materials that can harbor contaminated and potentially disease-causing agents. These
surfaces must be impervious to water to allow repeated and ongoing cleaning without the deterioration of the surface.

Outdoor housing facilities.

The framing on the largest shelter in the outdoor enclosure containing 8 Golden Retrievers is made of wood. According to

the facility representative, the wood is not water resistant or sealed against moisture.

A 12 to 16 foot long, approximately 10 inch wide board has been attached to the bottom of the wire fence to build a barrier
between two outdoor enclosures. The board was placed there to prevent the dogs from digging more holes under the
fence and entering the adjacent enclosure through those holes. Approximately 10 dogs have direct contact with the board

and the facility representative says the board is not water resistant or sealed against moisture.

One outdoor enclosure, containing approximately 12 dogs, has a metal access door inserted into painted plywood at the
entrance tothe shelter. The plywood has been chewed and damaged resulting in a hole in the plywood and unsealed

wood around the access door.

Surfaces of enclosures that have potential contact with dogs must be cleanable and sanitizable in order to prevent the
buildup of debris and other materials that can harbor contaminated and potentially disease-causing agents. These
surfaces must be impervious to water to allow repeated and ongoing cleaning without the deterioration of the surface.
The licensee must ensure that building surfaces in contact with animals in outdoor facilities are impervious to moisture.

Surfaces made of wood that is not pretreated to be impervious to moisture must be sealed.

Primary enclosures.

The whelping building has 57 enclosures that each include a whelping box in the back half of the enclosure and slatted
flooring enclosed by wire fencing in the front half. The floor slats are approximately 3 to 4 inches wide, but the gaps
between them are wide enough that the legs of puppies will easily and frequently fall through them. The inspectors
observed puppies in numerous enclosures and witnessed the legs of one or more of the puppies fall through the

openings.

During the inspection an adult Shih tzu was moved into the building and the inspectors observed her legs fall through the

gaps in the flooring.

APHIS officials had identified this issue to the licensee and facility representative at earlier visits to the facility, but no

action has been taken to correct the problem.

To prevent injuries to legs and feet, puppies need a safe stable surface to move and learn to walk on. To protect them

from injury, all dogs require a safe floor surfaces that will not allow their legs to pass through.

Primary enclosures must have floors constructed in a manner that does not allow the dogs' feet to pass through any
openings in the floor. The licensee must alter the floors in a manner that will not allow the feet of the dogs to pass

through. The licensee must ensure that all flooring is safe for the dogs at all times.

Watering

An enclosure in the sheltered housing building containing an adult female Shar-pei and 7 unweaned puppies has an
empty water bowl and no other source of potable water. The facility representative explained that the bowl had been filled

earlier this morning and must have been spilled.

One enclosure in the large Whelping Building, containing one adult dog and six puppies, has an empty water bowl and no

additional source of potable water.

An outdoor enclosure containing approximately ten adult dogs has one water bowl that is nearly empty and the remaining

water is a mud brown color with a buildup up of brown sediment and debris inside it from the dogs entering the bowl water

with their dirty paws. One dog was observed sitting in the water bowl. The outdoor temperature was in the low 90s.

For their overall health and wellbeing, dogs need to have potable water available at all times. This is even more important

during times of extreme heat and requires frequent monitoring by facility staff.

The licensee must ensure that potable water is continuously available to all dogs.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

Approximately seven feeders, located in various enclosures through the facility and affecting approximately 20 dogs, have
a brownish buildup of material on the bottom-front edge of the feeder that looks like a combination of powered feed and

dirt.

In the whelping building, two enclosures with 2 dams and approximately 12 unweaned puppies, have a dry brownish
material smeared on some of the vertical surfaces of the whelping boxes which appears to be caused by the dogs
jumping up and putting dirty, feces covered paws against the walls. One enclosure had a similar brownish crusty material

on the livestock panel across the front of the enclosure and hair was trapped in the crusty material.

Two of the outdoor enclosures, containing approximately 15 dogs, have shelters that contained dried and fresh fecal

material on the floors and a dry brownish material smeared on the some of the vertical surfaces of walls.

The buildup of dirt and fecal contaminated material in enclosures and shelters exposes dogs to bacteria and contaminants

that are disease hazards. This is particularly hazardous when the soiled surfaces are in food and water receptacles.

Primary enclosures, including the shelters within them, and food and water receptacles, must be sanitized at least once

of the straw bedding is dark in color and compacted together in a solid pile and the inspector had to pull the layers of
straw apart. The layers of straw were wet, dirty, moldy and had a strong odor of mold. In one of the shelters, accessed
by eight dogs, the contaminated straw was peeled up to reveal a colony of ant-like insects beneath it and in another
affected shelter, accessed by nine dogs, flying gnat-like insects came out of the contaminated straw. The facility

natural position. The licensee must ensure that transport enclosures provide the required amount of space for each dog

in order to support their health and well-being.

To be corrected by: The facility representative returned the dogs to their primary housing enclosures or separated the
dogs into compliant transport enclosures at the time of the inspection.
3.19(e)(1)

Terminal facilities.

Five dogs are contained in transport enclosures waiting to be moved to another location. The enclosures are sitting in
front of the kennel along the driveway and are provided with no shade to protect them from direct sunlight. Two of the
transport enclosures are constructed of plastic with a solid top, but one of the transport enclosures is a wire crate with no
solid top. The inspectors requested the facility representative to provide the dogs with shade which was done. Failure to
provide protection from the direct rays of the sun could cause the dogs to become overheated which could have a

detrimental impact on their health and well-being.

Shade must be provided that is sufficient to protect the dog from the direct rays of the sun. The licensee must ensure that

all dogs housed in transport enclosures have sufficient shade as protection from the direct rays of the sun in order to

support their health and well-being.

To be corrected by: The facility representative provided shade to the dogs at the time of the inspection.

Why is he allowed to continue, anyone else without all the paperwork he did not have because he's
covering up and lying about his activities, would be out of business. Yet, he continues to be able to

violation. Didn't the inspector look at his paperwork, etc., on 3-12, this man is still doing some brokering.

Does he have to pay a fine for destroying papers, he obviously is not paying USDA his broker fees. This
is not fair to the rest of the breeders.

He is currently and has been for some time brokering dogs. Supposedly, he is telling everyone his
inspector told him it was OK for him to do that because of COVID. Since when does a virus make it ok for

Subject: Daniel Gingerich (506618)

On 28-July-2021, | conducted a focused inspection at Daniel Gingerich’s site #001 with 3 employees of
IDALS: Alissa Puffett, Abigail Martens, and Dr. Kevin Taylor. During the inspection, Dr. Taylor asked me
if | knew whether Daniel had any dogs in two buildings located to the east side of his property. | stated
that we had never been taken on an inspection of those two buildings and believed the buildings did not
house dogs. Dr. Taylor said there were dogs in those barns and that we needed to have Daniel show us
the buildings. Dr. Taylor requested to see the buildings and Daniel took us inside both where we found a
total of approximately twenty-five adult dogs and ten puppies along with two dead dogs. One of the adult
dogs was severely emaciated. Neither the buildings nor the enclosures were compliant to house dogs.

Daniel stated that one of the buildings (the horse barn) were dogs that he was boarding for someone
else. Neither myself or the IDALS inspectors could remember the person’s name, but the individual is not
licensed with the USDA or IDALS. Later that day he gave the dogs to Steve Kruse (9245) to take control
of and house compliantly. Daniel moved one of the dogs (an adult female with ten puppies) into his own
whelping building.

| asked Daniel e had never shown me these buildings. so they could be inspected and he said “I
don’t know wh ever showed you these buildings”. is Daniel’s kennel manager.

| asked Dr. Taylor how he knew Daniel had dogs in these buildings. He stated that he had been to this
location last fall with the Wayne County Sheriffs office due to a complaint. Daniel wasn’t present at the
facility that day, but Dr. Taylor and the Sheriff were given access to the facility and walked through all the
buildings on the property and had found dogs in the two buildings in question at that time. During the
inspection on July 28", Dr. Taylor said he walked near the buildings and could hear dogs barking. That
was when he then told me there were dogs in those buildings and he requested that Daniel show us the
buildings.

On 29-July-2021, | conducted another focused inspection at Daniel Gingerich’s site #001 with Dr. Bill
Janecke, VMO. After completing the inspection of the buildings and areas housing dogs we requested to
walk through all the other buildings on the property. Daniel took us through the other buildings and we
found no dogs inside of them. | then asked to see the basement under his house. | had remember that
either Daniel orfiihad at one time mentioned keeping puppies in the basement of the house. Daniel
agreed to show us the basement of the house where we found 2 puppies housed inside stacked wire
crates inside a small closet-like area. Daniel said he had told his wife to get these puppies out of here
and didn’t know why they were still in the basement. Daniel said the puppies were recovering from Parvo
and the AV would be seeing them that evening. One of the puppies appeared depressed and lethargic
and was sitting up and leaning against the side of the enclosure with her eyes closed. She did not appear
to feel well. The other puppy was housed in an enclosure that was not tall enough and there was not 6
inches of space above the puppy’s head and the top of the enclosure. | believe with 100% confidence
that if | had not requested to see the basement, Daniel would not have shown us the puppies kept there.

Dr. Bill Janecke and | conducted a focused inspection at Steve Kruse’s facility in West Pont, IA, on Friday

July 30, 2021, to check on the health of a group of 37 dogs that were transferred from Daniel Gingerich.

We had disposition forms for those dogs in our possession. We conducted the inspection with
employee. Mr. Kruse was not present. No NCI’s were identified during the inspection.

The dogs that had been transported from Daniel Gingerich’s on 7/29/2021 were being kept in group of
enclosures separated from the rest of Steve Kruse’s dogs. We observed a total of 43 dogs that were
transferred from Daniel’s facility on 539.2021, SRAM cate that the 37 dogs for which we had
disposition forms were transferred into the facility on that morning, and 8 additional dogs were
transferred in the late afternoon.

Photos were taken of the documents and will be uploaded into e-File with Daniel Gingrich’s
inspection report. eG noted “DAN” in his notes for some of the dogs. We inquired what DAN
meant. BAR ndicated the DAN designation meant that Mr. Gingerich had not purchased these dogs
from Steve Kruse. Finally I indicated that many of the dogs were dirty and matted and that
the Golden Retrievers and all but three of the Samoyeds were groomed and bathed.

During the inspection, we identified 35 dogs using the APHIS 7006 disposition sheets and a microchip
reader. The other two dogs on our forms were the two that had tested positive for Heartworm disease
and had been euthanized by

On 25-August-2021, myself and VMO Autumn Unck conducted a Focused inspection at Daniel
Gingerich’s site #001. At the end of the inspection we were discussing the dogs that Daniel had hidden in
the barns on the property and had not presented for inspection. Autumn asked Daniel’s employee
MB he had known the dogs were in the barn and he said “Yes, | knew the dogs were there, but

Daniel told me not to show the dogs to the USDA unless they specifically asked to see those buildings.
So, | didn’t show them to you as | was doing what my employer told me to do.”

then said that she and had both told Daniel not to keep dogs in those barns
as it wasn't right and the dogs shouldn't be living like that. They both also stated that they were relieved
that Daniel was now having to get rid of all the dogs as he had just kept getting more and more and they
found it impossible to keep up.

OFFICIAL NOTICE OF 21 DAY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE 42-A-1632
Dear Mr. Gingerich,

I write to notify you that your license (42-A-1632) under the Animal Welfare Act
(7 U.S.C. § 2131 et seq.) (AWA or Act) is hereby suspended, pursuant to section
19 of the Act, for a period of 21 days, effective upon your receipt of this letter.

We are taking this action because we have reason to believe that you have
willfully violated, inter alia, sections 2.1, 2.40(b)(2), 2.50(a)(1), 2.75(a)(1),
2.80(a), 2.126(a), 2.126(a)(4), 2.126(b), and 2.131(e), of the regulations issued
under the AWA (9 C.F.R. Part 2)(Regulations), and failed to meet the minimum
standards for animals, (9 C.F.R. Part 3)(Standards), specifically 9 C.F.R. §§
3.1(a), 3.1(b), 3.1(c), 3.1(e), 3.1(f), 3.3(e)(1), 3.4(b), 3.4(c) 3.6(a)(2)(v), 3.9(b),
3.10(a), 3.11(b)(2), 3.11(b)(4), 3.11(c), 3.11(d), 3.13(a), 3.13(b)(2), 3.15, and
3.19(e)(1). Our evidence reveals that, between March 11, 2020, and September
2, 2021, you failed to, inter alia: provide a program of adequate veterinary care,
properly identify animals, maintain proper records, alleviate the impact of
climatic conditions on the animals, allow proper access and inspection of records
and property, maintain structurally sound housing facilities, provide continuous
potable water, provide proper cleaning and sanitization, provide appropriate
shelter, and maintain minimum requirements set out for primary enclosures of
the animals.

It is a violation of the Regulations to buy, sell, transport, exhibit, or deliver for
transportation, any “animal,” as that term is defined in the Act and the
Regulations, during the period of suspension. 9 C.F.R. § 2.10(c). This
prohibition applies to you and to any employee, agent or other person acting on
your behalf. Failure to comply with this prohibition may subject you to sanctions
authorized by the Act. 7 U.S.C. § 2149.
