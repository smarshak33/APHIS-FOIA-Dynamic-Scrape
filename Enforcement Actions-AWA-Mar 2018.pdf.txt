CITATION AND NOTIFICATION OF PENALTY

We believe that you violated the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. § 2131 et seq.)
(AWA), as described below.

Date of Alleged Violation: March 4, 2015

9 C.F.R. § 3.19(b)(2) Handling. Any person handling a primary enclosure
containing a dog or cat must use care and must avoid causing physical harm or
distress to the dog or cat. ...A primary enclosure containing a dog or cat must
not be tossed, dropped, or needlessly tilted, and must not be stacked in a
manner that may reasonably be expected to result in its falling. It must be
handled and positioned in the manner that written instructions and arrows on
the outside of the primary enclosure indicate.

Delta accepted a cat (Maxwell) for transport in commerce from John
Fitzgerald Kennedy Airport (JFK) via Flight DL 2364; to Hartsfield-
Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL). Delta failed to handle
Maxwell as carefully as possible in a manner that did not cause
trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
Delta personnel did not use proper care when unloading Maxwell
from Flight 2364. Maxwell’s kennel fell from the belt loader causing
the lid to crack, allowing Maxwell to escape. Consequently, a Delta
Air Lines baggage tug struck/ran over and killed Maxwell.

The penalty for the alleged violation(s) described above is $10,000.

Date of Alleged Violation: May 15, 2013 (NV130009-AC)
9 C.F.R. § 3.14(a)(1) Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.

You accepted a cat (Kato) for transport, in commerce, from Maui, Hawaii, to
Las Vegas, Nevada and failed to ensure that the primary enclosure used to
transport the cat was strong enough to withstand the normal rigors of
transportation, and contain the animal securely and comfortably. Upon

You failed to move a dog as quickly and efficiently as possible. You accepted
a dog (Mschief) for transport in commerce, from Kansas City, Missouri (MCI)
to Chantilly, Virginia (IAD). The consignor delivered the dog to United at
9:30am on July 3, 2014. The original flight was cancelled and United
arranged for Mschief to travel from MCI to Chicago O’Hare International
(ORD), via flight 6229, to connect with a later flight to its final destination.
You retrieved Mschief from flight 6229 at approximately 9:00pm on July 3,
2014. The employee parked the van in a dedicated parking space at United’s
cargo building and failed to offload Mschief from the van. Mschief remained

veterinary care as soon as possible. The sugar gliders were shipped in a
transparent plastic shipping container lined with a breathable mesh, and within
this container, they were placed inside an open microfiber bag or pouch,
which made it difficult or impossible to observe the animals without opening
the shipping container. United employees brought the sugar gliders back to
the office after they were not loaded on their originally-scheduled flight and
reported that they were alive. The SPOT agent checked the sugar gliders into
the PetSafe facility and reported that she heard them “chirping”, but did not
visually observe them The employees did not open the shipping container
while the animals were held at the PetSafe facility. The animals were in

was not opened to visually observe the animals until it was delivered to the
consignee and she opened it. Upon arrival at the final destination, the sugar
gliders were deceased.

You failed to construct your facility of such material and strength as

chewed, leaving two holes in the wall;

metal wire running along the bottom of the enclosure which was above
ground;

along with a section of metal flashing that was loose and bent outwards;

5. The gate to the male camel’s yard was broken on the lower left corner; and
6. The metal feeder for the kangaroo and Patagonian cavy was coming apart at
