MISCELLANEOUS.

*** On September 23, 2016 two ferrets on protocol 16-06-024B escaped their cage. The staff observed through the
window during the AM check that the bottom cage door was ajar. Once the staff accessed the room he was only
able to locate one of the two ferrets. Ferret #15145 was not found and the facility has yet to discern how the animal
escaped the room. The staff was trained to double check the enclosures with the understanding that they have the
potential to not latch. During questioning the staff member mentioned that there could be a chance that the door
was not properly secured. There are other advantage points in which the animal could have escaped the secondary
containment but not the primary containment.

Animals should be handled carefully, in such a manner that does not cause them trauma, physical harm, or
unnecessary discomfort. The facility should ensure that corrective actions for handling issues will prevent similar
problems from occurring in the future.

The facility has implemented additional enclosure locks on the cage to ensure they are secured once closed. Also

there have been other corrections implemented on the second containment. The facility self-reported the incident to
APHIS officials.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian.

At the time of inspection there were three rams observed in the front pasture that were limping, and noticeably lame.
The licensee had not noticed the lameness, and had not contacted the veterinarian.

Failure to observe animals on a daily basis in order to detect any problems that might affect their well-being could
result in unnecessary suffering, and / or a poor medical outcome for the animals.

The licensee must consult with his veterinary practitioner as soon as possible, and initiate a treatment plan for any

currently lame animals within 48 hours. All animals should be observed on a daily basis, with any problems promptly
reported to the attending veterinarian, from this time forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.

MISCELLANEOUS.

On August 7, 2016, there was an incident involving gerbils in which intraperitoneal injections were administered and
next day 4 gerbils were found dead and 4 were euthanized by the attending veterinarian.

The PI self reported the incident to the IACUC and had a discussion with the research staff which concluded that
the culture media was contaminated due to a change in color of the culture media (yellow) which indicates that the
ph had change and there was a possibility of contamination. Regardless of the observation the staff decided to
wash the cultures with antibiotic media and proceeded to administer it to the animals.

The PI acknowledge that this is not an acceptable or standard working practice.

The PI provided a corrective action plan to the IACUC containing an sop for injection of gerbils and another sop for
retraining the staff involved in handling of materials used for injection in the study. Also samples suspected of been
contaminated will be reported to the PI and not injected to the animals. The PI will monitor laboratory staff to ensure
the corrective actions are properly followed.

The Plan was reviewed by the IACUC and approved and later implemented by the PI. The IACUC considered the
matter resolved in the September monthly meeting.

The incident was managed and corrected by September 23, 2016.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.

2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.

A seven year old, female, white-faced capuchin monkey named Kaytee, bit an adult male person on July 17, 2017
while on public display. The licensee stated that the incident occurred when an adult male entered the business an
unknowingly stood too close to the area where the capuchin was located. The licensee also stated that the capuchin
was Startled by the distracted person who stepped back into the public barrier. It subsequently bit the person on the
back of the left leg, leaving multiple bite wounds above the ankle. The monkey was on a leash behind the public
barrier which consisted of a single chain attached to plastic posts. The chain had enough slack or was loose
enough, to allow the person to unintentionally enter the animal area.

Failure to provide sufficient distance and/or barriers during public exhibition can be a safety hazard for the animal
and/or the public. During public exhibition, the animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the
animal and to the public with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public

so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.

To be corrected by: 5:00 PM on July 19th, 2017.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.

* Buck Ill, a male Pug eM) (5), (D) (CO) has a left eye sphere with a slight to moderate conical shaped
protrusion that comes to a point over the pupil. When viewing the eye from the side it also looks like the pointed

protrusion area has a little bubble on the tip. Underneath the conical shape appears to be a hazy white to blueish
discoloration resembling fog. There is a small amount of mucoid -like discharge on the lower eyelid. The right eye
sphere has a slight conical shape with a flattened point over the pupil. There also appears to be a hazy white
coloration underneath the protrusion. This type of disfigurement of the eye sphere may be indicative of injury,
disease or other health issues. Licensee must consult a veterinarian to ensure that this disfigurement is not painful,
indicative of other disease or health issues or cause impending blindness and that any treatment required is
provided for the well-being of the dog.

3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.

* A bottom enclosure with vinyl wire flooring on the westside of New Kennel is broken and corroding away along
where the flooring and back wall meet.

The vinyl wire for a top row enclosure on the westside of the New Kennel is broken, separating alon the vertical
seam and coming apart along the bottom of the enclosure door. The broken section of wire is starting to protrude
outward.

These two enclosures, housing five adult dogs total, with broken wire can allow for the dogs feet or face get stuck in
the wire potentially causing injury. Dogs could try to escape from the gap caused by the broken wire in the top

enclosure potentially causing injury.

For the prevention of injury, all enclosures must be kept in good repair and contain the animals.

3.1(¢)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.

* The outside part of two enclosures on the northeast sided of the Old Kennel had vinyl wire dividers. The vinyl was
coming off these dividers in areas exposing bare wire. This bare wire was excessively rusty and corroding. The
end enclosure had a metal gate that was excessively rusty and corroding in areas. This can prevent the required
cleaning and sanitization of these surfaces that could harbor disease organisms. The structural strength can be
jeopardized as well.

All surfaces must be free of excessive rust that can cause the prevention of required cleaning and sanitization, and
affects the structural strength for the three adult dogs.

To be corrected by, 10-September-2017.

3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.

* Feces and other waste is starting to accumulate outside an opening approximately 3 yards from the dog
enclosures housing a total of 11 adult dogs. The close location of waste and opening in the building are a insect,
rodent and other vermin attraction. There were also puddles of water on the floor from a recent cleaning. The
attraction of standing water inside and fecal waste located so close to the building with available openings will
attract flying insects (mosquitoes, flies, gnats) that can cause injury, disease and stress to the animals.

Licensee must ensure that regular and frequent collection of waste, fluids and other debris are conducted in such a
way as to minimize vermin and pest infestation, insects, odors and disease hazards.

To be corrected by, 26-August-201 7.

* A white intact female beagle identified by the licensee as “Snow,” with a (date of birth of 01-02-2014) was
observed to have abnormal eye discharge and red glandular tissue protruding from the 3rd eyelid area of both
eyes. The surface of the left eye also appeared cloudy. Examination of the mouth revealed a buildup of dense
brown material in contact with the gums along the upper right and left cheek teeth with reddening of the gum lines.
The licensee stated that the dog had not been seen by a veterinarian and there was no documentation provided at
the time of inspection to indicate that the dog was being treated for any ocular conditions.

Cloudiness, discharge and protrusion of tissue from eyes can be an indication of on-going eye disease. Untreated
eye diseases may lead to increased animal discomfort, acute eye pain and blindness. Reddening or inflammation of
the gums with debris/plaque buildup on teeth and at the gum line may be an indication of beginning dental disease.
Untreated dental issues may result lead to animal discomfort, difficulty chewing and weight loss.

This dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian within the next 72 hours to ensure that an accurate diagnosis
is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of all identified conditions, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon
request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.

affecting the health and well-being of the dog.

* An adult, female, Beagle with no identification, has excessively long toe nails on all four paws. Some of the toes
nails were curving around and underneath the dog's foot pads. Long toe nails can get stuck in the holes of the
flooring and break off causing injury. This can be very painful for the dog and affect the normal gait. All dogs must
have regular toe nail maintenance. From regular toe nail maintenance, the prevention of abnormal gait, injury from
long toe nails breaking off and growing is minimized.

* There was a bottle of Oxytocin intermingled with other medications and ready for use that had an expiration date
of Feb 17.

Medications must be labeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure that the contents of the
container can be known with certainty, that the drugs are used at safe doses, and that medications are not used
past their expiration dates. Expired drugs may not work as anticipated, could become contaminated, and could
harm the animals. The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired, labeled
properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices, and are stored in accordance with manufacturer's
recommendations.

identify animals due to the scanner having been previously eaten by dogs in the kennel. Three additional dogs,
previously identified on inspection on 016 with veterinary care issues, were also unable to be identified for
follow up verification of treatment. The inability of the licensee to readily and correctly identify animals within the

Inspection Report

* Four enclosures housing 10 adult dogs and eight puppies had sharp wires or points protruding into the
enclosures. These protruding points were at eye level and lower for the dogs in these enclosures. One enclosure
had wire securing and feed. This wire was protruding into the enclosure. This could cause injury to the dogs.

All enclosures must be free of sharp protruding points that could injure the animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.

* Heat lamps with exposed bulbs were found in two primary enclosures located in the whelping building. The heat
lamps were found to be within reach of adult dogs located in both enclosures. Neither heat lamp contained a guard
to prevent contact of the heat lamp bulb or heat lamp with adult dogs held within the enclosures.

Heat lamps with exposed heat lamp bulbs placed within contact reach of animals may present a burn or electrical
hazard to those animals held in the enclosure. Bulbs may additionally become broken and pose a sharp physical
hazard to 2 adult dogs and 4 puppies.

All heat lamps need to be placed out of physical reach of animals or provided with guards to prevent direct contact
with animals within the enclosures.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.

* The northwest enclosure in the Corncrib Kennel had a long large gap between where the vinyl wire flooring and
enclosure paneling meet. The vinyl wire was broken along this gap exposing sharp points. The four adult dogs
housed in this enclosure could be injured from the legs and feet passing through the gap or from getting their legs or
feet stuck in the gap.

All grid or vinyl wire type flooring must not allow the feet and legs of the dogs to pass through any openings for the
prevention of injury to the animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.

* The underneath areas and wash down for the Corn Crib Kennel, and Wash down and underneath area for east
outdoor enclosures had an accumulation of fecal waste, fluid waste and dog hair. A strong odor of urine and waste
was present in the Corn Crib Kennel. This was noticed with strong draft and open doors. The accumulation of fecal
waste, fluid waste and dog hair can increase disease hazards and attract insects and pests affecting the 18 adult
dogs housed in these areas.

For the prevention of an accumulation of dog hair fecal and fluid waste, and for the reduction of orders, insects,
pests and disease hazards, all areas underneath the enclosures must be cleaned more frequently.

3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.

Two large hog feeders being used for feeding 12 adult dogs in two occupied kennel enclosures were found to be
contaminated with bird feces on their interior surfaces. The affected kennels were located on the north end of the
corn crib kennel building. One of the feeders also supplied food for dogs in a third adjoining kennel. A total of
twelve dogs were being fed from the feeders.

Contamination of animal food receptacles with bird feces may result in the transmission of disease causing
organisms which can pose a health hazard to dogs being fed from the receptacles.

Food receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized, utilizing one of the methods described under 3.11 (b)(3), at least

every two weeks or more often as necessary to prevent accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and other
disease hazards.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and Randall Wagner (ACI).

* A white intact female beagle identified by the licensee as “Snow” (with a date of birth of 01-02-2014) was observed
to have abnormal eye discharge and red glandular tissue protruding from the 3rd eyelid area of both eyes. The
surface of the left eye also appeared cloudy. Examination of the mouth revealed a buildup of dense brown material
in contact with the gums along the upper right and left cheek teeth with reddening of the gum lines. The licensee
stated that the dog had not been seen by a veterinarian and there was no documentation provided at the time of
inspection to indicate that the dog was being treated for any ocular conditions.

Cloudiness, discharge and protrusion of tissue from eyes can be an indication of on-going eye disease. Untreated
eye diseases may lead to increased animal discomfort, acute eye pain and blindness. Reddening or inflammation of
the gums with debris/plaque buildup on teeth and at the gum line may be an indication of beginning dental disease.
Untreated dental issues may result lead to animal discomfort, difficulty chewing and weight loss.

This dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian within the next 72 hours to ensure that an accurate diagnosis
is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of all identified conditions, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon
request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.

affecting the health and well-being of the dog.

* An adult, female, Beagle with no identification, has excessively long toe nails on all four paws. Some of the toes
nails were curving around and underneath the dog's foot pads. Long toe nails can get stuck in the holes of the
flooring and break off causing injury. This can be very painful for the dog and affect the normal gait. All dogs must
have regular toe nail maintenance. From regular toe nail maintenance, the prevention of abnormal gait, injury from
long toe nails breaking off and growing is minimized.

* The last document visit by the attending veterinarian (AV) was on 20-April-2016. With potential veterinary care
issues cited for three dogs from the inspection on TE 201 6, and dogs on this inspection, another yearly visit
by the (AV) is needed.

* There was a bottle of Oxytocin intermingled with other medications and ready for use that had an expiration date
of February 2017.

Medications must be labeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure that the contents of the
container can be known with certainty, that the drugs are used at safe doses, and that medications are not used
past their expiration dates. Expired drugs may not work as anticipated, could become contaminated, and could
harm the animals. The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired, labeled
properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices, and are stored in accordance with manufacturer's
recommendations.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.

* Four enclosures housing 10 adult dogs and eight puppies had sharp wires or points protruding into the
enclosures. These protruding points were at eye level and lower for the dogs in these enclosures. One enclosure
had wire securing a self-feeder. This wire was protruding into the enclosure. This could cause injury to the dogs.

All enclosures must be free of sharp protruding points that could injure the animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.

* Heat lamps with exposed bulbs were found in two primary enclosures located in the whelping building. The heat
lamps were found to be within reach of adult dogs located in both enclosures. Neither heat lamp contained a guard
to prevent contact of the heat lamp bulb or heat lamp with adult dogs held within the enclosures.

Heat lamps with exposed heat lamp bulbs placed within contact reach of animals may present a burn or electrical
hazard to those animals held in the enclosure. Bulbs may additionally become broken and pose a sharp physical
hazard to 2 adult dogs and 4 puppies.

All heat lamps need to be placed out of physical reach of animals or provided with guards to prevent direct contact
with animals within the enclosures.

outdoor enclosures had an accumulation of fecal waste, fluid waste and dog hair. A strong odor of urine and waste
was present in the Corn Crib Kennel. This was noticed with strong draft and open doors. The accumulation of fecal
waste, fluid waste and dog hair can increase disease hazards and attract insects and pests affecting the 18 adult
dogs housed in these areas.

For the prevention of an accumulation of dog hair fecal and fluid waste, and for the reduction of orders, insects,
pests and disease hazards, all areas underneath the enclosures must be cleaned more frequently.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.

Two large hog feeders being used for feeding 12 adult dogs in two occupied kennel enclosures were found to be
contaminated with bird feces on their interior surfaces. The affected kennels were located on the north end of the
Corn Crib Kennel building. One of the feeders also supplied food for dogs in a third adjoining kennel. A total of
twelve dogs were being fed from the feeders.

Contamination of animal food receptacles with bird feces may result in the transmission of disease causing
organisms which can pose a health hazard to dogs being fed from the receptacles.

Food receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized, utilizing one of the methods described under 3.11 (b)(3), at least
every two weeks or more often as necessary to prevent accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and other
disease hazards.

2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.

During a public feeding opportunity on 16 October 2016, a child was bitten by a pygmy hippo. The child was allowed
to get close enough to the pygmy hippo that when she tried to throw the food, the animal bit her hand. The child
required medical attention due to the bite. During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal
risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the
general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. To be corrected from this point forward.

3.75(c)(1)(ii)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.

The wire for the guillotine door system for two enclosures in the colobus building goes through an opening in the
metal ceiling. The metal ceiling is torn at both of these openings, resulting in a jagged edge. In addition, the wire for
one of the door systems in this building is rusted and fraying. The frayed ends of this metal wire are sharp to the
touch. Both the torn metal on the ceiling and the frayed wire are within reaching distance for the nonhuman primates
in the enclosures. Sharp and jagged metal can cause injury. Any surfaces that come in contact with nonhuman
primates must be free of jagged edges or sharp points that might injure the animals. To be corrected by 23
November 2016.

3.75(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.

A bale of peat moss stored in the large barn and used to enhance the bedding of nonhuman primates has been
opened and is not being stored in a sealed container. Also, an open bag of primate biscuits being stored in the
freezer near the large barn is open and not being stored in a sealed container. Unprotected food and bedding can
deteriorate and can become contaminated with pests. Open food and bedding supplies for nonhuman primates
must be kept in leak-proof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent spoilage and contamination. To be corrected
by 19 November 2016

FACILITIES, GENERAL.

There is a board missing which creates a gap on the top of a resting platform in both a honey badger enclosure and
a lynx enclosure. There is a rusted metal support on the sliding door in a serval enclosure. There is a broken wood
board at the base of a warthog enclosure. These structures are not structurally sound and can lead to injury. The
facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.

The licensee was missing paperwork for at least one fox that had been sold in the past six months. In addition, the
licensee's current inventory was not up-to-date. Not properly keeping sales records or maintaining an up-to-date
inventory does not allow for proper tracking of the animals by an APHIS official. All sales records must be kept for

During inspection the licensee informed me that one of her foxes ("Notchi", a silver and white male born April 2016)
had escaped from her while she was walking it on January 1st, 2017. As of the time of inspection, the licensee had
not captured the fox. A fox that escapes from the control of the licensee is at risk of being preyed upon by other
animals. In addition, the fox may not have the skill set to survive on its own when it is not under control of the
licensee. The licensee must ensure that the foxes have no means of escaping from the licensee's control. Correct
immediately.

2.33(b)(4) CRITICAL

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.

***In September 2016 the facility self-reported an incident to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) and
USDA. The facility suspended a protocol as a result of inadequate intraoperative monitoring, as approved in the
study protocol, and subsequent failure to identify a malfunctioning heating pad that may have contributed to the
unexpected death of a rabbit undergoing a non-survival surgical procedure. According to anesthesia records, there
was a period of approximately 4 hours in which no temperature was recorded while the animal was under
anesthesia for this procedure. This is contrary to the approved protocol which states that a rectal temperature will be
monitored and recorded every 15 minutes. Written records indicate that the animal died while under anesthesia and
it is recorded that the animal’s blood pressure dropped due to hypothermia and hemodilution. It was also noted in
the records that the water-heated mat under the animal had turned off, leading to hypothermia. The veterinary staff
was not immediately notified of intraoperative problems or of the animal’s death. A necropsy was not performed on
the rabbit. By monitoring the temperature at more frequent intervals, changes in temperature may be identified and
addressed sooner. The facility identified that proper steps to ensure the health and welfare of the animal may not
have been taken because records to substantiate those efforts were inadequately maintained. The facility must
ensure that proper guidance is provided to principal investigators and their personnel involved in the care and use of
animals regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization and euthanasia at all times. The
research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to
OLAW and USDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent future occurrences. Corrective
actions taken include, but are not limited to, retraining of all personnel involved, a submitted plan to ensure
adequate expertise of the research team performing procedures and amending the protocol to include contacting
veterinary staff immediately if complications occur. This item has been corrected by the facility.

The inspection was conducted on March 7-9, 2017 and an exit interview was conducted on March 9, 2017 with
facility representatives.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.

In August 2017 the facility self-reported the following incident to the USDA. On June 1, 2017 an adult male
cynomolgus macaque died unexpectedly during transport to necropsy after the conclusion of a MRI and PET scan
procedure. The IACUC self-identified that there was non-compliance with the facility’s IACUC policies and a failure
to follow the protocol. The animal was under anesthesia during the procedure and there were gaps in physiological
monitoring (i.e. So02, PR, RR, EtCO2, body temperature and BP) based on the records, which should have
occurred every 15 minutes. For example, there were no entries on anesthetic monitoring recorded between 3:47 am
and 4:26 am (39 minutes); there were no entries for temperature or EtCO2 from 3:47 am to 8:20 am (4 hours, 33
minutes); and there was a lack of physiologic monitoring recorded between 7:00 am to 8:20 am (80 minutes). Also,
the animal experienced ongoing complications such as hypothermia, hypotension, wet lung sounds and fluid in the
endotracheal tube during the anesthetic procedure. The first documented rectal temperature near the start of the
procedure at 3:47 am was recorded as 95.7 degrees F. Although a Bair Hugger had been placed on the animal
around 4:25am, the next recorded temperature continued to be decreased at 94.8 degrees F at 8:20 am. Although
the animal’s temperature began to slowly increase after this time, the animal’s recorded SpO2 dropped to 85% at
9:25 am (ranging 81%-91% from 9:25 am to 11:05 am) while previously being recorded mosily in the mid to upper
90’s. Wet lung sounds and removal of some fluid from the endotracheal tube were first documented by the
laboratory veterinary technician at 8:00 am. A veterinarian was contacted by phone by the PI approximately 6 hours
into the approximately 8 hour procedure, at which time the veterinarian’s suggestions were followed. Although
interventional steps were taken, including assistance from the Division of Comparative Medicine's (DCM) veterinary
technicians, and the laboratory staff felt the animal was stable, the animal’s Sp02 values continued to be low and
the animal died before the planned euthanasia. The IACUC also determined that the on-call veterinary staff should
have been contacted prior to when a veterinarian had been called given the ongoing complications noted
throughout the procedure.

By monitoring and recording physiologic parameters during anesthetic procedures at regular intervals, and as
according to the protocol and facility’s policies, changes in those parameters may be identified and addressed
sooner. This can decrease possible negative effects on the health and well-being of the animal.

Inspection Report

The research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to
OLAW and USDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent future occurrences. Corrective
actions taken include, but are not limited to, retraining of the PI and laboratory staff, requiring use of DCM’s
anesthesia monitoring record and a period of increased monitoring of the laboratory’s physiological records. This
item has been corrected by the facility. The facility must ensure that it maintains programs of adequate veterinary
care that include guidance to principal investigators and other personnel involved in the care and use of animals
regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization, and euthanasia at all times.

The inspection was conducted on August 23-25, 2017 and an exit interview was conducted on August 25, 2017 with

facility representatives.

***According to the hands on veterinary inspection conducted on October 28, 2016, there were three adult dogs
identified as Bella, a Toy Poodle DOB 10/1/11, Raven, a Toy Poodle [aM DOB 1214/05
and Prince, a Toy Poodle hese three dogs were diagnosed with severe periodontal disease
according to the veterinarian's records. The licensee stated that these dogs were no longer at the facility. When
asked if they had received treatment for the periodontal disease prior to leaving the facility, the licensee stated that
the veterinarian had not been contacted for treatment and had received no treatment prior to being re-homed. Lack
of veterinary care for appropriate diagnosis or treatment can worsen the current condition, delay healing or result in
death. The licensee must assure that all regulated animals receive adequate veterinary care as required.

The licensee understands that this is to be corrected from this day, June 15, 2017, forward.

October 28, 2016 with severe periodontal disease, according to the hands on veterinary inspection. The licensee
stated that this dog had not been taken to the veterinarian for treatment nor had there been any discussion with the
veterinarian concerning treatment. Upon observation of this dog, thick amounts of brown, yellow and green
substance covered approximately 30%-60% of the front teeth, the back teeth were completely encased with a thick
brown substance. The gum lines appeared to be receded. Dental care is essential for prevention of infection, oral
injuries, diseases and promotes the overall health of the animal. The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a
veterinarian, the treatment plan documented, followed and assure that all of the dogs receive adequate veterinary
care as required.

of the whelping building in an enclosure containing one adult Saint Bernard and six puppies. There was also 2-4
cups of food waste observed on the ground in at least two of these enclosures. When asked how often these
enclosures were cleaned, the facility representative stated every 2-3 days.

***In the whelping house, there was an enclosure containing an adult female Miniature Pinscher and 10 puppies
approximately three weeks old. This enclosure floor was completely covered with feces (including the plastic type
box that some of the puppies were in). The adult nor the puppies could not walk, stand, sit or lay anywhere in this
enclosure that was not covered in feces. A blanket was on the floor of this enclosure, yet it too contained feces. The
puppies were soiled on their feet and on their backs. Accumulations of waste products increase the risk of disease
by attracting and providing a harboring place for pests and creating an unhealthy environment for the animals. The
licensee must assure that all waste material is removed from the primary enclosures daily as required.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.

***In the whelping building, there was an open trash receptacle beside the door. There were ants crawling from the
trash, up the wall to the window above. Pests carry diseases which increases the risks of contamination to the dogs,
water and food supply. The licensee must rid this area of the ants and assure that measures are taken to reduce

contamination by pests as required.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.

***In the outdoor portion of the sheltered facility, there was an enclosure containing two adult Miniature Pinschers.
On the south side of this enclosure, grass was growing through the fence. Tall weeds and grass create a harboring
place for pests and parasites and increases the risks for contact between pests, parasites and the dogs. The
licensee must clear the grass so that it does not enter the primary enclosure and assure that such items are
controlled as required.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).

On April 25, 2016 two groups of Japanese Macaque’s were introduced. One female identified as “Yoko” was injured
during the introduction and sustained more injuries overnight according to keeper records. The animal was
observed to have additional injuries on April 27 and on April 28 she was observed huddling in a corner and did not
eat her mid-day or pm diet. There were no daily observations made for this animal the next two days and on May 1,
2016 she had wounds apparent, her eyes were closed and she was shaking. On May 3, 2016 she was examined by
the vet and humanely euthanized due to extent of her injuries. There is no indication in the records that “Yoko's”
condition was communicated to the vet in a timely manner. The facility stated that the veterinarian can access the
daily keeper logs for all animals and is sent a report for these issues but there is no follow up information indicating
the vet was aware of the extent of injuries. Given the number of animals at the facility and the severity of these
injuries reliance on checking daily logs is not considered adequate communication. Additionally there are no records
for three days when the animal was showing visible signs that she was in pain and potential distress. The facility
needs to address the mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that accurate and timely information for
problems on animal health and behavior is conveyed to the attending vet.

from the troupe. This lasted for a period of 9 days until she was examined by the vet and then euthanized due to
injuries. Records noted the animal was following the troupe but also staying away from the other animals. Two
animals in particular “Kathy” and “Debbi” were noted to be aggressive to “Yoko”. Despite observations that the

2.1 REPEAT
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.

At the time of search, this facility had two sugar gliders offered for sale. The owner confirmed that these animals
were obtained from a breeder and he was advertising and selling the sugar gliders in the store. The retail sale of
exotic animals (including small exotics such as sugar gliders not bred by the seller) require a USDA License under
the Animal Welfare Act.

Additionally, the facility had 2 adult sugar gliders with at least 2 babies on exhibit in the middle of the store. The

enclosure for these animals did not advertise the sale of these animals and both the employee in the store owner
confirmed that these animals were not for sale.

The current business model (both resale and exhibition of sugar gliders) require a valid USDA License to be in
compliance with the Animals Welfare Act.

Correct by discontinuing all exhibition and regulated activities until a valid USDA License has been obtained. No
regulated activity can be conducted until a USDA License is obtained.

An Employee of the business was present at the facility during the search.

The exit briefing was conducted with the Owner of the facility by phone at the time of inspection.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.

The self-reported incident from August 26, 2015 associated with protocol # 13041668 indicated that 23 adult rabbits
had tissue samples collected via ear snip. The protocol indicates that these tissue samples should only be collected
from 10 day or 25 day old rabbits. The principal investigator followed the protocol for the use of analgesia, however
this approved analgesia was meant for the 10 day or 25 day old rabbit and not the adult. According to the document
reporting this incident as well as in discussions with members of the IACUC, the attending veterinarian at the time of
the incident determined that the analgesia used at the time of the procedure was not adequate to alleviate the
associated pain, and that adequate follow-up analgesic treatments were not provided.

After a full investigation of this incident by the IACUC, corrective actions were taken by the principal investigator to
ensure that this incident would not occur again. A letter of reprimand was sent from the IACUC to the principal
investigator and their supervisor regarding this incident. This investigator and their staff completed of retraining on
protocol adherence. The protocol has been further reviewed by the IACUC and amended to include non-invasive
sample collection methods for the adult rabbits.

The self-reported incident from October 13, 2015 associated with protocol # 1414544 indicated that an adult rabbit
(R463-15) had died following being anesthetized for protocol approved imaging. This animal was returned to its cage
while still in lateral recumbancy. On October 14, 2015 the animal was found deceased. The necropsy by the
veterinarian noted lung consolidation with respiratory distress and subsequent arrest as the likely cause of death.
The universities surgical policy at the time of this event stated that animals must be observed and monitored post
operatively until they are awake and show evidence of spontaneous and voluntary movement within their cage,
before returning to their respective animal holding rooms. This policy was not followed by the investigator at the time
the animal being returned to the caging area.

After a full investigation of this incident by the IACUC, corrective actions were taken by the principal investigator to
ensure that this incident would not occur again. A letter of reprimand was sent from the IACUC to the principal
investigator and their supervisor regarding this incident .The principal investigator and their staff were retrained on the
universities surgical policy and were counselled on their responsibilities in caring for these animals. The surgeon for

related to the care of animals in this protocol. The protocol has been further reviewed by the IACUC and amended to
include reversal agents to ensure that animals are able to regain consciousness as expected at the completion of a
procedure.

As a result of the principal investigators departing from established SOPs for care, adequate pre-and post-procedural
care was not provided in accordance with established veterinary procedures. All personnel at the university,
including principal investigators that have direct care for animals, are responsible for ensuring that these standards
are maintained.

Correct from this point forward.

Inspection was conducted with Compliance Coordinator and Veterinary Medical Officers Kurt Hammel and Michael

2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).

During this auction inspection, the inspectors identified two animals that were in need of acute veterinary care:

1) During a walk through of the back barn area a male mini Highland bull on 5/5/17 was noted lying on its right side
and minimally responsive to the opening of its stall door at approximately 10:15 am. A few minutes later the bull had
a seizure. The inspectors notified an auction staff member and the attending veterinarian. No one was observed
going to evaluate or treat the bull. Over the rest of the day the bull was observed again by the inspectors at 11:15
am, 12:20 pm, 4:40 pm and 6:00 pm. Seizure activity of varying intensity and duration was observed at multiple
time points. The attending veterinarian was asked about the bull at about 2 pm and stated that he gave a penicillin
injection about 1 pm. The inspectors again talked to the veterinary staff about the bulls declining condition and
asked if the veterinarian was considering providing any pain relieving medication or treatment. The inspectors
learned later from the veterinarian that a steroid injection was administered. By the 6:00 pm observation point the
bull was completely unresponsive with fixed eyes but was still warm and breathing. On the morning of 5/6 the bull
was no longer in the stall. The veterinarian stated that it had died overnight. No documentation of veterinary care
was available for review.

2) On 5/5/17 one brown and white goat was noted lying down on its side in a pen housing multiple goats. The other
goats were stepping on and over the goat with no response by the goat. An auction employee was notified and
asked to remove the goat. The goat was rehoused in a pen by itself. It was noted to be weak but was able to sit up
by leaning against a solid wall. The auction staff did not contact the veterinarian to obtain an evaluation of the
trampled, weak goat.

Adequate veterinary care is necessary for acute conditions that can lead to distress and suffering of the animals.
The facility is responsible for identifying veterinary issues, communicating with the veterinarian about the issues and
ensuring adequate veterinary care to include treatment for those animals needing emergency care while at the
auction.

Inspection Report

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.

On the morning of 5/4/17 the inspectors watched the auction staff moving llamas from the auction ring back into
their holding pens. One adult male auction staff member was noted kicking and using a short crop to move the
llamas into their pen. One particular llama that was deemed to be aggressive was shoved into a separate pen using
the pen fence by the same adult male auction staff member.

A young male auction staff member was observed relocating a lamb by grasping the wool on its back with one hand
and dropping it over a 4 foot high fence into a pen.

On the afternoon of 5/5/17 a Watusi was observed by the inspectors running loose in the parking area at the rear of
auction building. The animal escaped during the loading process. Several auction staff members were seen to be
chasing the animals on foot as well as with a fork lift. The inspectors lost sight of the animal when the Watusi ran
off the auction property. The animal was eventually secured.

Kicking, whipping, shoving and mishandling of animals causes behavioral stress, discomfort and can result in injury
to the animals. All animals shall be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not
cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.

2.131(e) REPEAT

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.

*Numerous outdoor pens/enclosures in the back behind the covered barn pens/stalls are open to the elements with
no sides or overhead protection from inclement weather. The weather on 5/4/17 started out grey, overcast, and
cool. During the day it remained cool and rained most of the day. The weather remained cold, windy and rainy on
5/5. The watusi, cattle, bison, and water buffalo were noted to be wet and several were seen shivering. One very
young nearly newborn watusi calf housed by itself was noted to be wet and shivering and lying curled up in the mud
in the corner closest to the barn on 5/5. Another watusi calf was also noted shivering in a pen by itself. The very
young calf was watched for 10 minutes and was noted to be full-body shivering throughout the observation

period. The inspectors notified an auction worker about the calves. The worker moved the calves into stalls in the
sheltered area of the barn.

*Several wire cages of very young pigs including pot belly piglets were placed on the ground just inside the arena
barn loading area. The large door was open and a strong wind was blowing in cold air and rain. Multiple pigs were
noted shivering especially those with wet bedding. All the employees in the area were wearing jackets/coats. The
piglets had no protection from the cold wind. The inspectors notified staff and asked that the situation for the pigs be
improved and the staff built a windbreak out of bales of hay and closed the damaged door as far as was possible.

Cold weather coupled with wind and rain makes it difficult for animals, especially young animals, to maintain their

core body temperature. Inability to maintain appropriate body temperatures can predispose animals, especially
young animals, to increased risk of disease due to stress, discomfort and hypothermia. When climatic conditions
present a threat to the animals health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of
these conditions.

3.36(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.

On the morning of 5/5/17 the inspectors observed 2 young guinea pigs running loose on the floor of the warm room.
The guinea pigs had escaped out of a hole in the side of the cage that was comprised of plastic mesh. The guinea
pigs were secured and returned to the cage by the auction staff without incident. The auction staff then secured the
hole in the cage using plastic coated wire.

Animals that escape their primary enclosures may be injured, predated, or die. To protect the animals from these
potential outcomes the primary enclosures must be constructed such that structural strength is sufficient to contain
the animals.

The cage was secured during the inspection.

3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.

On days 5/4-5/17 the inspectors observed goats and sheep of various ages and sizes running loose in the arena
barn.

There was a green metal fence panel that comprised the wall of a pen housing goats and sheep that was damaged.
The panel section was broken such that a substantial gap was created which could allow animals to escape. The
panel also had a bent, torn metal rod that created a potentially injurious object to animals housed in each adjacent
pen.

There were two adjacent pens housing sheep and goats that had a gap between the wall of the building and the
panel separating the two pens. One goat was noted to have placed its head through the gap into the adjacent pen.

The wooden support beams of the section of the back barn that has isolated pens (for exotic hoofstock) were
observed to be broken and soaked with water. One board acting as a ceiling over the pens was so soaked and
waterlogged that it was held up only by a pen door that was partially open. Water was observed to be dripping from
the ceiling of the broken area inside the barn.

Inspection Report

A rubber hose, one standing metal fan and a black, broken plastic bucket were being stored in a pen used to house
a single sheep in the arena barn.

Indoor and outdoor housing facilities need to be structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain them. Correct from this day forward.

3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.

Numerous outdoor enclosures/pens in the back behind the covered barn stalls/pens are open to the elements with
no sides or overhead protection from inclement weather. The weather on 5/4-5/6/17 was rainy, windy and cold. The
animals outside including water buffalo, watusi, bison and cattle had no protection or shelter to allow them to remain
dry. The dirt in their enclosures quickly became wet sloppy mud and standing water. The animals’ haircoats became
wet. Several animals were noted shivering, especially two young watusi calves. Wet haircoats make it difficult for
animals, especially the young, to maintain their core body temperature. The standing water and mud in the
enclosures was over ankle deep for many of the animals. The animals’ feet made sucking sounds when they lifted
them to move about in their enclosure. This may lead to slipping of the animals, hoof problems and injury. In
addition the inability to get out of the wet weather may lead to distress to the animals. Live animals shall be provided
protection to allow them to remain dry during inclement weather.

3.137(d)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.

During the morning of the 5/5/17 the inspector observed a single housed hedgehog in a plastic container with wood
shavings on the bottom that were thoroughly soaked with fluid such that the bedding was a dark brown instead of a
light yellow. The walls of the plastic container had visible condensation.

On the afternoon of 5/5/17 the inspectors observed a single housed pot belly pig in a wire mesh cage with a wooden
floor to be standing in wood shavings that were completely soaked and dark brown. The cage was placed on the
ground in front of a large sliding door at the back of the arena barn. The animal had no dry spot to lay in and was
showing evidence of discomfort by shivering.

On the morning of 5/6/17 the inspectors observed a young fox housed in a plastic crate with a solid plastic bottom
floor in the warm room with no bedding material.

Wet bedding can no longer absorb and cover excreta which can cause the animal injury, distress, and increased

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).

During this inspection, the inspectors identified two animals that were in need of acute veterinary care:

1) On 3-3-16 several people were noted congregated in front of a stall housing goats. Two of the people were
overheard voicing concern and were upset over a couple of newborn goat kids in the enclosure that appeared weak
and unable to rise on their own and thus could not nurse. One very small brown goat kid was noted making high
pitched crying noises. Every few minutes it would try to lift its head or one of its legs but could not do so for more than
a couple of seconds. It was unable to rise on its own. A second white with brown on face goat kid was also noticed to
be weak and lying in a position with its legs unnaturally splayed. Both kids appeared thin with a pronounced bone
structure especially compared to the other set of newborn goat kids in the same enclosure. An auction staff member
was notified and tried to assist the kids with nursing by holding them up to the mother goat. The staff member stated
that the vet tech staff knew about the birth that morning but had not been informed about their current weakness. The
attending veterinarian was consulted by the inspectors and had not been notified about the goat kids. The goat kids
were no longer present at the auction on 3-4-16.

2) During a walk through the auction barn on 3-4-16 an addax (#7628) was noted missing its left horn. There was
freshly clotted blood on its head and running down the left side of its face from the wound where the horn had been.
Review of the consignment form indicated "broken horn". A conversation with auction staff indicated they consigned
the addax with a horn that broke off during transport to the auction. The attending veterinarian was unaware of the
addax.

3) On the morning of 3-5-16 one capybara (#176) was noted with a fresh moist bright red lesion on the top of its nose
about 1/2 in x 1 inch in size. No veterinary attention had been sought.

Lack of adequate veterinary care for acute conditions can lead to distress and suffering of the animals. The facility is
responsible for identifying veterinary issues, communicating with the veterinarian about the issues and ensuring
adequate veterinary care to include diagnosis and treatment for those animals needing emergency care while at the
auction.

Inspection Report

2.131 (6) (1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.

On the morning of 3-3-16 the inspectors watched the auction staff moving goats and sheep from their enclosures to
the auction ring. One young adult man with reddish hair was noted kicking and using a whip on the animals that he
considered moving along too slowly. When a second auction staff member noted us observing them, the young adult
man was taken aside and the whip was exchanged for a plastic guide pole. Later that same day, several young boys
helping out with the movement of the sheep and goats were noted physically pushing, shoving and pulling goats and
sheep rather than allowing them to move along at their preferred speed. During this entire time the boys were loudly
yelling at the animals. Again when the older more experienced staff noted the presence of the inspectors, they told
the younger boys to end the aggressive behavior.

Kicking, whipping and shoving of animals results in behavioral stress, discomfort and possible injury to the animals.
All animals shall be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.

2.131 (e)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.

Numerous outdoor pens/enclosures in the back behind the covered barn pens/stalls are open to the elements with no
sides or overhead protection from inclement weather. The weather on 3/3/16 started out grey, overcast and snowy.
After a couple of hours, the snow changed over to rain that continued through the afternoon. One young watusi was
noted to be wet and shivering and exhibited a tucked-up body, indicating discomfort. The calf was watched for 10
minutes and was noted to be full-body shivering throughout the observation period. The temperature at that time was
recorded at 40.1 degrees Fahrenheit. Cold weather coupled with snow and rain makes it difficult for animals,
especially young animals, to maintain their core body temperature. Inability to maintain appropriate body
temperatures can predispose animals, especially young animals, to increased risk of disease due to stress,
discomfort and hypothermia. The calf was rechecked on 3-4-16 and appeared to be more comfortable and dry and
was no longer shivering. When climatic conditions present a threat to the animals health or well-being, appropriate
measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of these conditions. Correct from this day forward.

3.38 (a)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.

On 3-5-16 the inspectors noticed several hamsters curled up inside the water receptacle in an enclosure housing 17
young hamsters. The auction staff emptied the receptacle of the hamsters-it was dry. Water was added to the water
receptacle and seven hamsters immediately started trying to drink simultaneously with several trying to push their
way to the water. The hamsters’ drinking continued for at least 10 minutes. A small amount of dry pelleted food was
present in the food receptacle. Access to potable water is necessary for the health and well-being of all animals.
Hamsters shall have access to food and water or a type of food which provides the requirements for food and water
sufficient to satisfy their food and water needs. Corrected during the inspection.

3.127 (b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.

Numerous outdoor pens/enclosures in the back behind the covered barn pens/stalls are open to the elements with no
sides or overhead protection from inclement weather. The weather on 3/3/16 started out grey, overcast and snowy.
After a couple of hours the snow changed over to rain. The animals outside (including water buffalo, watusi, bison,
cattle) had no protection or shelter to allow them to remain dry during the snow and rain. The dirt in their enclosures
quickly became wet sloppy mud and standing water. The animals’ haircoats became wet. One young watusi was
noted shivering during the afternoon. Wet haircoats make it difficult for animals, especially young animals, to maintain
their core body temperature. The following morning on 3/4/16 the standing water and mud in the enclosures was
over ankle deep on the animals. A second watusi calf was noted trying to stand in a corner with a tiny patch of green
growth and drier ground to avoid the mud. The animals' feet made sucking sounds when they lifted them to move
about in their enclosure. This may lead to slipping of the animals, hoof problems and injury. Live animals shall be
provided protection to allow them to remain dry during inclement weather such as snow and rain.

3.128 REPEAT
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.

Two pens in newer smaller barn next door to the large arena barn were noted containing so many sheep and goats
that the animals could not turn around freely or lie down without being trampled by other animals on 3-3-16. The
animals were of multiple sizes and some of the smaller animals were noted standing underneath the larger/taller ones
as they had nowhere else to go. The pens measured approximately 6ft x 9.75 ft. One contained 28 animals. The
second contained 20 animals.

Two pens in the large arena barn were noted containing so many llamas and alpacas that the animals could not turn
around freely or lie down without risk of getting trampled on 3-3-16. The pens measured 5ft x5ft and 5ft x 6ft and each
contained five llamas/alpacas .

Overcrowding can lead to stress, discomfort, injury and overheating. Enclosures/pens used to house animals shall be
large enough to ensure that each animal contained therein has sufficient space to turn about freely and to make
normal postural adjustments (stand, sit and lie down).

3.131 (c) REPEAT
SANITATION.

Varying lengths of twine were noted on the ground and tied to enclosures and within easy reach of the animals
throughout the facility. One goat and one watusi cross, housed in different areas of the facility, were noted chewing
and eating the twine. Twine ingestion can lead to intestinal tract issues. The facility premises and grounds shall be
kept clean in order to protect the animals and facilitate prescribed husbandry practices. Accumulations of trash shall
be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary.

3.137 (a) (1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.

An adult African Crested Porcupine was housed in a wood and wire enclosure that had a damaged door and two
palm-sized openings close to and above the door. The damage to the door and the holes in the wire mesh appeared
to have been created by chewing and pulling by the animal inside the enclosure, as the door leaned precariously into
the cage. The whole door-side of the enclosure was unstable. Unsecure doors and open holes can lead to injury to
the animal and enable its escape. A temporary stabilization to the door was attempted but did not correct the
structural deficiencies noted above. Primary transport enclosures must be constructed in such a manner that the
structural strength of the enclosure is sufficient to contain the live animal and withstand the normal rigors of
transportation. Correct from this day forward.

Inspection conducted during the auction on 3-3-16 through 3-5-16.
Exit conducted by Susanne Brunkhorst, VMO, Mary Ann McBride, VMO and undersigned facility representative on
3/5/16.

ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.

Review of the Nov. 2015 auction records show multiple consignment forms in which the consignor is one of the
facility principals. It was established by conversation with the consignor that the animals were purchased elsewhere
(at an auction in Mississippi in Sept. 2015) and resold (brokering). There are no records available during the
inspection to show where or when the animals were originally acquired. They include the following: a total of thirty
four hedgehogs and one porcupine.

Each dealer shall have all records including all required acquisition records availabe to allow APHIS officials to
examine records required to be kept by the Act.

2.132 (d) REPEAT
PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.

*At the Nov. 2015 auction, two male capybara (consignor 837) were accepted/consigned without the owner/consignor
having a valid USDA license.

“At the Nov. 2015 auction, nine hedgehogs (five female and four male) were accepted/consigned (consignor #40 SF)
without the owner having a valid USDA license.

“At the Sept. 2015 auction, one neutered male kinkajou was “purchased in the parking lot" by an auction
principal/representative according to a conversation with the inspector and was then consigned under the auction

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).

On the morning of 9/11/15 the inspector identified three animals that were in need of veterinary care that had not
been thusly identified by facility staff.

1) A capybara (#1132) had red material resembling thickened blood on its nose.

2) A red banteng female (#6164) was noted squinting its left eye with a large amount of active tearing and tear
staining down the entire length of the right side of her face underneath the eye. She appeared agitated and tried to
turn her neck to rub the eye on her side.

3) A member of the public addressed me thinking | worked for the auction as she saw a newborn alpaca cria that was

having difficulty breathing and appeared very weak and the female alpaca (#2542) did not seem to be taking care of
it.

Review of consignment records did not document any health issues regarding these animals. The inspector notified
one of the principals of the auction who stated he would contact his veterinarian (on site). One of the vet techs later
notified me that the animals were being "monitored".

Followup of the three animals on 9/12/15 was conducted. The capybara had been sold. The banteng's eye appeared
much improved. She was no longer squinting and drainage was minimal. The alpaca cria had died.

The facility is responsible for identifying veterinary issues and ensuring adequate veterinary care to include diagnosis
and treatment for those animals needing emergency care while at the auction. Correct from this day forward.

“On 9/11/15 the USDA inspector was asked a couple of times by members of the public about animals as the person
assumed the inspector was an employee of the auction. One person who was extremely upset about the newborn
alpaca crea was desperately trying to find a staff member to notify. The inspector also

could not identify who the auction staff were as none were readily identiable. No one was wearing identifying clothing
or identification tags.

“On 9/11/15 the inspector noticed a man entering a stall with a large camel to interact with the camel. When asked if
he owned the camel, the man replied no and left the area. On 9/12/15 several members of the public were noted
crowding around a pen housing two baby zebra. The zebras became agitated and started bucking/trying to get away
from the people trying to touch them. No facility personnel were noted in the area monitoring the activity.

The licensee must provide readily identifiable, responsible and knowledgeable attendants during all periods of public
contact to ensure the safety of both the public and the animals. The public must be able to identify whom to contact
with concerns/questions. Failure to provide this oversight during public contact may lead to injury to the animals or
the public.

2.132 (d) REPEAT
PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.

During the auction, an unlicensed individual attempted to consign multiple hedgehogs that they had bred. The
individual stated they had sent in a USDA Animal Welfare Act license application and were in the process of obtaining
their license but had not yet completed the process. They were informed that a valid license had to be issued before
they could conduct regulated activity. A few hours later another unlicensed person brought in the same hedgehogs in
the same exact enclosures. When questioned, she stated that she had not bred the hedgehogs-she stated she had
gotten them from someone else. When informed that the brokering of exotic animals requires a USDA license, she
told the USDA inspector that that was not the case because she specifically asked one of the auction principals if it
was legal for her to sell the hedgehogs and he told her that it was. Once learning this information, she said she would
give the hedgehogs back to the person who gave them to her. No dealer shall knowingly obtain any animal from any
person who is required to be licensed but who does not hold a current, valid and unsuspended license.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.

Two dead animals were noted in an enclosure pen in the auction building section housing sheep and goats on the
morning of 9/11/15: one 2 horn Jacobs (#76) and one tan & black billy (#120). A strong unpleasant odor was noted
while standing in front of the pen. In the adjacent pen were live sheep and goats. Consignment forms were reviewed
for the animals and no notations of any health issues were noted. Multiple staff members were asked about what had
happened to the animals and why they were in the pen-most had no idea. One staff person stated that they stressed
and died during the auction process the previous day. Another staff person stated that they were still in the pen as
they still needed to have their ear tags removed prior to disposal. Disposal of dead animals needs to be done ina
timely manner to prevent distress to any nearby live animals and to prevent odors/attraction of pests. Corrected the
afternoon of 9/11/15.

“The outside locked area holding the cages for the exotic and pet species to include ferrets, prairie dogs, capybara,
cavy and wallabies needs cleaning. Spilled feed and discarded portions of bananas/banana skins were lying on the

“Twine and string pieces were noted on the ground and tied to enclosure stall boards in several of the stalls housing
the exotic hoofstock. A couple of fallow deer were noted chewing and eating the twine. Twine ingestion can lead to

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.

Several pens in the arena barn and in the newer smaller barn next door were noted containing so many sheep and
goats that the animals could not turn around freely or lie down without being trampled by the other animals on
9/11/15. The animals were of multiple sizes and some of the smaller animals were noted standing underneath the
larger/taller ones as they had nowhere else to go. One pen measuring 5ft by 8ft contained 19 sheep and goats. A
second pen measuring 6ft by 9 ft contained 27 sheep and goats. Two animals in one of the pens were noted trying to
fight--the surrounding animals tried to push their way away from the fighting ones but had no place to go.
Overcrowding can lead to stress, discomfort, injury and overheating. Enclosures/pens used to house animals shall be
large enough to ensure that each animal contained therein has sufficient space to turn about freely and to make
normal postural adjustments (stand, sit and lie down).

HANDLING.

Numerous outdoor pens/enclosures in back off the covered barn pens/stalls are open to the elements with no sides
or overhead protection from inclement weather. The weather on 9/11/15 started out dry, bright and sunny. A
thunderstorm with lots of rain appeared in the late afternoon/early evening. The animals outside (including water
buffalo, watusi, bison, cattle) had no protection or shelter to allow them to remain dry during the rain. The dirt in their
enclosures quickly became wet sloppy mud and standing water. One young water buffalo was noted bawling during
the storm. The rain stopped overnight. The following morning on 9/12/15 the standing water and mud in the
enclosures was over ankle deep on the bison. The animals' feet made sucking sounds when they lifted them to move
about in their enclosure. This may lead to slipping of the animals, hoof problems and injury. Fresh hay was thrown on
top of the wet mud which may lead to contamination of the hay being eaten by the animals. Live animals shall be
provided protection to allow them to remain dry during rain. Correct from this day forward.

Inspection conducted over two days 9/11/15-9/12/15. Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.

*During observation of the moving of the llamas and alpacas from their pens to the auction ring on Thursday 5/7/15 it
was noted that several of the llamas became stressed and agitated. They were noted spinning around and jumping
about in their pen instead of calmly moving out of the pen. One adult male employee dressed in a brown T shirt was
noted lifting his right leg completely off the ground and kicking one of the llamas repeatedly in the right side and
ventral abdomen and yelling at it. Other llamas also received kicks to speed along their movement.

*Also during observation of the moving of the llamas and alpacas for auction, one young boy in a blue and white
checkered woven shirt was noted carrying a white plastic guide pole. Randomly every now and then he was noted
jabbing a llama or alpaca through the enclosure bars with the pole. He and a couple of other boys then came up to a
llama in the aisle. He hit the llama on the head with the pole and then when the llama tried to run away he chased it
hitting it on its back and rump with the pole.

Kicking, jabbing and hitting of animals results in behavioral stress, discomfort and possible injury to the animals. All
animals shall be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort. Correct from this day forward.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.

One young dromedary camel was housed in an enclosure in the arena barn near the snackbar where young animals
are typically housed for auction attendees to view. During a ten minute span of observation by the inspector on Friday
5/8/15, every person/member of the public who walked by the camel stopped and petted it. One young man even
lifted up a Mayfield container of ice cream and let the camel lick the container. No readily identifiable employee was
noted in the vicinity. No employee came to tell the young man to remove the ice cream container from the camel s

Inspection Report

3.131 (c)
SANITATION.

The arena barn has sheets of insulation covering the walls and ceiling. Some areas are covered by plastic but in
others the plastic has been ripped and loose insulation is visible and falling down into the pens. Freshly fallen
insulation was noted in some enclosures housing goats and pigs. In addition, one pen housing two goats had a piece
of wood forming the back wall moved to the side and a large segment of exposed insulation was present at goat
height on the back wall. Insulation can be an irritant and may cause problems if ingested. The exposed insulation
needs to be removed or covered to prevent the insulation from coming in contact with or in reach of the animals.
Correct by Sept. 1, 2015.

3.137 (c) DIRECT NCI
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.

Several pens in the arena barn were noted containing so many sheep that the sheep could not turn around freely or
lie down without being trampled by the other sheep. For example, one 3.75ftx4ft pens contained 5 adult sheep.
Another pen approximately 6ftx10ft contained 21 sheep. One sheep was noted lying down in the very back of the pen
underneath the others and was getting stepped on. Some of the sheep had long thick coats and were noted breathing
heavier and fasting that the short haired ones. Overcrowding can lead to stress, discomfort, injury and overheating.
Enclosures/pens used to house animals shall be large enough to ensure that each animal contained therein has
sufficient space to turn about freely and to make normal postural adjustments (stand, sit and lie down). Correct from
this day forward.

3.142 (a) (1) DIRECT NCI
HANDLING.

Numerous outdoor pens/enclosures have been added to the area in back of the covered pens/enclosures. These
pens are open to the elements with no sides or overhead protection from direct sunlight. During the inspection, these
pens contained large hoofstock including bison, water buffalo, exotic cattle and watusi. The high temperatures during
the day ranged from 87 to 90 Degrees F. The temperatures measured by Kestrel measured from 87 to 91. Some of
the animals were noted in the same pen on both Thursday and Friday. On Friday one very young brown exotic bovine
calf (#4038) was noted with rapid respiration. It tried to find some shade where the bars created striped shadows. The
calf 's respiratory rate was 122 breaths per minute in the early afternoon. The attending veterinarian was asked and
also considered this rate above normal. Elevated respiratory rates can be an indication of early heat stress. When
sunlight is likely to cause overheating or discomfort, sufficient shade shall be provided to protect the live animals from
the direct rays of the sun. Correct from this day forward.

Inspection conducted over two days 5/7/15-5/8/15. Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.

*During observation of the moving of the llamas and alpacas from their pens to the auction ring on Thursday 5/7/15 it
was noted that several of the llamas became stressed and agitated. They were noted spinning around and jumping
about in their pen instead of calmly moving out of the pen. One adult male employee dressed in a brown T shirt was
noted lifting his right leg completely off the ground and kicking one of the llamas repeatedly in the right side and
ventral abdomen and yelling at it. Other llamas also received kicks to speed along their movement.

*Also during observation of the moving of the llamas and alpacas for auction, one young boy in a blue and white
checkered woven shirt was noted carrying a white plastic guide pole. Randomly every now and then he was noted
jabbing a llama or alpaca through the enclosure bars with the pole. He and a couple of other boys then came up to a
llama in the aisle. He hit the llama on the head with the pole and then when the llama tried to run away he chased it
hitting it on its back and rump with the pole.

Kicking, jabbing and hitting of animals results in behavioral stress, discomfort and possible injury to the animals. All
animals shall be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort. Correct from this day forward.

2.131 (qd) (2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.

One young dromedary camel was housed in an enclosure in the arena barn near the snackbar where young animals
are typically housed for auction attendees to view. During a ten minute span of observation by the inspector on Friday
5/8/15, every person/member of the public who walked by the camel stopped and petted it. One young man even
lifted up a Mayfield container of ice cream and let the camel lick the container. No readily identifiable employee was
noted in the vicinity. No employee came to tell the young man to remove the ice cream container from the camel s
reach. The licensee must provide readily identifiable, responsible and knowledgeable attendants during all periods of
public contact to ensure the safety of both the public and the animals. Failure to provide this oversight during public
contact may lead to injury to the animals or the public. Correct from this day forward.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).

“Review of the "Animal Notebook" during this inspection revealed a signature sheet signed by the attending
veterinarian on 9/12/14 documenting a visit by the vet. There was no copy of the actual written program of veterinary
care in the notebook. The owner was reached by phone and asked if the attending veterinarian had been out to the
facility since 9/12/14 and he stated that the vet had been out to the farm for the spring exhibit season. The veterinary
clinic was reached by phone and stated that the clinic records show that the most recent farm visit by the veterinarian
was the 9/12/14 visit.

*A sick black and white pig was noted during the [ili 5 inspection. The veterinarian was not consulted about the
pig for a diagnosis and treatment plan.

Regular veterinary care to include preventative care and diagnosis and treatment of illnesses and injuries is
necessary for the health and well-being of the animals and to help prevent the spread of potential zoonotic conditions.
The facility must provide daily observation of all animals and must communicate directly in a timely manner with the
veterinarian to ensure that the veterinarian has accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-
being. The facility shall ensure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of
adequate veterinary care. Correct from this day forward.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).

An adult female fallow deer " Penny" was noted to have a firm swelling protruding from the jawline under the ear on
the right side. The swelling was approximately 6 inches in diameter, missing hair from the affected skin, appeared
inflammed, was red and crusted in the center. The licensee stated he first noticed the swelling about one week ago
and had discussed the problem with a veterinarian but the animal had not yet received any treatment.

Abnormal swellings can be a sign of infection, disease or other condition that could adversely affect the health of the
animal and/or cause discomfort if left untreated. The deer must be seen and assessed by a veterinarian and receive
appropriate treatment and follow-up applicable to the diagnosis.

Correct by: This non-compliant item was corrected by close of business June 12, 2017.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.

An enclosure primarily housing deer, a guanaco and some pigs and goats at the rear of the facility:

*Has fencing on the north side of the enclosure that is bent and broken in two sections. The original height of the
fence is compromised in the damaged areas.

*Has a damaged and bent section of fencing on the west side. The fencing is partially wrapped or attached around a
metal support and has sharp points protruding from the edges that could be accessible to the animals.

*Has two single strands of tightly anchored barbed wire on or next to the ground on the interior of the enclosure.
The barbed wire can be stepped on or tripped over by the animals. The licensee stated the wire was a foundation
for fence construction that had not been completed.

Inspection Report

Housing facilities must be kept in good repair to safely contain the animals and prevent injury. The enclosure
fencing should be repaired or replaced and the animals should be protected from contact with barbed wire.

3.131 (a)

SANITATION.

The floor of the coati mundi enclosure is constructed of wood. The floor was damp, appeared soft and was
splintered in some areas. A build up of food, hair and wood pieces were noted on the south end at the junction of
the wall and floor. Eggshell, wood pieces and flies were spread through out the floor. The licensee stated that the
floor is currently cleaned only by flushing with water.

The enclosure floor appears water logged and unsealed and is therefore unable to be adequately cleaned.
Unsealed wood, continuously saturated with moisture, animal waste, food debris, flies and subsequently cleaned
only with water, can become a breeding ground for bacteria and contribute to disease hazards. To protect the health
of the animals changes should be implemented to ensure appropriate sanitation of this enclosure.

Correct by: June 20, 2017.

3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.

Several goats and a guanaco were housed in an enclosed area in front of the facility that contained a storage
building. The building contents were open to the enclosure because one half of the door was missing. Directly
adjacent to and in front of the building were solid metal panels, fence panels, plastic sheets and wire projecting from
a trash can. Accidental access to and contact with these items could result in injury to the animals. Accumulations of
trash, discarded and unused items should be cleared as necessary from animal enclosures to maintain the health of
the animals and protect them from injury.

3.131(d) REPEAT

SANITATION.

Excessive numbers of black flies covered the wooden floor of the primary enclosure housing the two coati mundis.
Hundreds of flies were noted in the enclosure, on cage furnishings and the chain link walls. Insects can cause
irritation to the animal by biting or swarming. Flies can also transmit disease causing pathogens. A safe and
effective program for insect control must be established and maintained.

Type: FOCUSED INSPECTION
Date: 08-AUG-2017

2.31(d)(1)(xi) CRITICAL REPEAT

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).

This inspection was a focused inspection to verify correction of items previously documented as non-compliant
during the previous USDA inspection on April 11 2017. The facility has not yet corrected deficiencies previously
cited under 2.31 (d)(1)(xi) for euthanasia of guinea pigs with carbon dioxide gas. This is a repeat critical
non-compliance.

The method of euthanasia for guinea pigs in the facility utilizes tanked carbon dioxide gas delivered to a euthanasia
chamber. The chamber is a galvanized tub covered with a clear acrylic plastic lid. A pressure reducing regulator is
connected to the gas tank and is used to control gas pressure from the tank to the gas supply line going to the tub
enclosure. No flow meter or other monitoring device is present in the system to monitor gas flow rates into the
chamber. A facility manager stated the outflow pressure of gas from the tank is set at 30 psi at the regulator. The
facility written euthanasia procedure states “turn on the CO2 at 20 to 50 pounds PSI until no further animal
movement is observed.”

The described facility procedure for euthanasia of guinea pigs with carbon dioxide gas does not meet current
standards set forth in the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition. The procedure in use by
the facility lacks a flow meter to accurately maintain and monitor consistent gas flow rates to the chamber during the
euthanasia process. The use of a tank regulator pre-set at a specific psi is not sufficient of itself to ensure that an
accurate flow rate of carbon dioxide gas is being consistently delivered to the euthanasia chamber and
recommended gas displacement rates are being achieved. Without an appropriate sized flow meter in place,
chamber gas displacement rates may be too high or too low. This may then lead to significant pain and distress to
guinea pigs during the euthanasia process.

AVMA guidelines for carbon dioxide gas usage recommend a chamber displacement rate of 10-30% of chamber
volume/minute. This displacement rate has been found to produce less pain and distress during the onset of
unconsciousness than other rates.

Inspection Report

Overall, methods of euthanasia used must be in accordance with AVMA species guidelines and in accordance with
9 CFR part 1, unless a deviation has been previously justified in writing and approved by the IACUC.

A flow meter and appropriate methodology shall be employed to ensure that accurate carbon dioxide gas flow rates
and chamber displacement rates are consistently maintained and monitored by facility personnel during the

euthanasia process. In conjunction, animals need to be visually monitored by personnel throughout the euthanasia
process and SOPs updated with required flow meter settings. Retraining of all employees who perform euthanasia

shall also be done and documented.

Regarding deficiencies previously cited on last inspection under 2.33 (b)(2), the facility has corrected the
deficiencies, Contact information for the attending veterinarian and provision of emergency, weekend and holiday
veterinary care have also been posted within the animal facility.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Manager of Regulatory Affairs, Director of Regulatory
Affairs, QC- Microbiology Supervisor and the QC - Microbiology Manager.

2.31 (d) (1) (xi)

This inspection was a focused inspection to verify correction of items previously documented as non-compliant
during the previous USDA inspection on April 11 2017. The facility has not yet corrected deficiencies previously
cited under 2.31 (d)(1)(xi) for euthanasia of guinea pigs with CO2. This is a repeat critical non-compliance.

Facility procedure for euthanasia of guinea pigs with carbon dioxide does not adhere to standards listed in the
current AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition. The guidelines allow for carbon dioxide
euthanasia of laboratory rodents (which include guinea pigs) when the flow of carbon dioxide provides a
displacement rate of 10-30% of chamber volume/min. This is best achieved by the use of flow meter to ensure an
accurate flow rate of carbon dioxide gas is being delivered to the chamber at the recommended displacement rate
(10-30% chamber volume/min).

The method currently employed by the facility lacks a flow meter and method for accurately determining the
chamber displacement rate. The output dial in current use by the facility utilizes regulator pressure readings (psi)
which do not provide accurate flow rates for carbon dioxide into the chamber.

Carbon dioxide exposure using a gradual fill method with chamber displacement rates from 10-30% is less likely to
produce pain and distress prior to onset of unconsciousness than higher or lower rates. Methods of euthanasia
used must be in accordance with AVMA species guidelines and in accordance with 9 CFR part 1, unless a deviation
has been previously justified in writing and approved by the IACUC.

A flow meter must be installed, SOPs updated with required flow meter settings, and retraining of employees who
perform euthanasia shall be documented.
