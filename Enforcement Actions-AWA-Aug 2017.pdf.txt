INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).

On 10 September 2015, procedures relating to one study protocol were not conducted as approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). A surgical procedure was performed under general
anesthesia but pre-operative analgesics were not used as described in the approved protocol.

Although the animal was under general anesthesia, the impact upon the animal related to analgesia is unknown. As
the investigator included pre-operative analgesics in the study protocol that was approved by the IACUC, the animal
may have experienced unrelieved pain.

Procedures must be conducted in a manner to assure that discomfort and pain to animals will be limited to that
which is unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically valuable research, including provision for the use of analgesic,

anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs where indicated and appropriate to minimize discomfort and pain to animals.

The noncompliance was corrected prior to the inspection.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with Facility Representatives.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.

On Monday May 15, 2017 zoo employees found a jaguar out of its enclosure at morning check. The jaguar was
sedated and returned to its holding cage without incident. A spider monkey in the enclosure next to the jaguar
enclosure was injured by the jaguar and had to be euthanized.

The current jaguar enclosure has housed jaguar for many years without an escape. There were no obvious failures
in the construction of the exhibit and it is still unclear exactly how this animal escaped. The current pair of jaguar
are younger animals and may have been able to squeeze through small gaps between wire mesh and metal rods
previous cats could not fit through. However, the jaguar enclosure failed to contain the jaguar and the spider

monkey enclosure failed to protect the monkey from injury.

During this inspection the zoo explained its plans to more securely attach the metal mesh covering the top of the
exhibit to the metal rods along the perimeter of the enclosure.

To be corrected prior to allowing jaguars back into the exhibit.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with zoo personnel.

This was a focused inspection on the jaguar escape.
