SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

Dear Sir or Madam:

We believe that you violated the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. § 2131 et seq.)
(AWA), as described in the attached Settlement Agreement. Our agency, the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), is responsible for enforcing
the AWA, and other agriculture laws that help prevent the spread of animal and
plant pests and diseases, and ensure the welfare of animals.

After providing you with an opportunity for a hearing, we may impose civil
penalties of up to $10,000, or other sanctions, for each alleged violation described
in this Settlement Agreement. We are offering you the opportunity to resolve this
matter by paying an amount that is much lower than the maximum civil penalty.

What are the terms of the Settlement Agreement?

You should review the information in this Settlement Agreement, including the
citation and notification of penalty.

If you agree to waive your right to a hearing and pay the penalty, then do the
following:

o Pay the amount due, $5,000, by March 26, 2018. You can pay by
check, money order, or credit card. For your convenience, we
have included additional instructions for making payments.

o If you are unable to pay the full amount due by March 26, 2018,
you may be eligible for a payment plan. To request a payment
plan, you must use the enclosed form to submit a written response
to this letter by March 26, 2018, that indicates you wish to pay the
penalty and waive your right to a hearing. You must also submit a
copy of your most recent federal tax return. As part of your
response, please include a phone number and an email address so
that we may contact you.
