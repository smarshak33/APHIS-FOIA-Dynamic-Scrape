§ 3.1(c)(1)(i) Housing facilities, general.

General requirements. The surfaces of housing facilities — including houses, dens, and other furniture-
type fixtures and objects within the facility —- must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that
allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. Interior
surfaces and any surfaces that come in contact with dogs or cats must be free of excessive rust that prevents
the required cleaning and sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface.

Date(s): (b) (6), (b) (7)(C) 2016 (REPEAT)
§ 3.9(b) Feeding.

Food receptacles must be used for dogs and cats, must be readily accessible to all dogs and cats, and
must be located so as to minimize contamination by excreta and pests, and be protected from rain and snow.
Feeding pans must either be made of a durable material that can be easily cleaned and sanitized or be
disposable. If the food receptacles are not disposable, they must be kept clean and must be sanitized in
accordance with § 3.11(b) of this subpart. Sanitization is achieved by using one of the methods described in
§ 3.11(b)(3) of this subpart. If the food receptacles are disposable, they must be discarded after one use. Self-
feeders may be used for the feeding of dry food. If self-feeders are used, they must be kept clean and must be
sanitized in accordance with § 3.11(b) of this subpart. Measures must be taken to ensure that there is no
molding, deterioration, and caking of feed.

Date(s): October 20, 2016 (REPEAT)
§ 3.11(a) Cleaning, sanitation, housekeeping, and pest control.

Cleaning of primary enclosures. Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures
daily, and from under primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of
feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs or cats contained in the primary enclosures, and to
reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. When steam or water is used to clean the primary enclosure,
whether by hosing, flushing, or other methods, dogs and cats must be removed, unless the enclosure is large
enough to ensure the animals would not be harmed, wetted, or distressed in the process. Standing water must
be removed from the primary enclosure and animals in other primary enclosures must be protected from

committed violations of the following sections of the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 9:

Date: September 13, 2014
§ 3.140(a) — Care in transit.

During surface transportation, it shall be the responsibility of the driver or other employee to visually observe the live
animals as frequently as circumstances may dictate, but not less than once every 4 hours, to assure that they are
receiving sufficient air for normal breathing, their ambient temperatures are within the prescribed limits, all other
applicable standards are being complied with and to determine whether any of the live animals are in obvious physical
distress and to provide any needed veterinary care as soon as possible.

You failed to seek veterinary care as soon as possible for a caracal named Ivan that was in obvious physical
distress during transit. An employee noticed vomit on the floor of the caracal’s enclosure during transit and
observed that Ivan did not appear to be acting normally and was resting his head on the floor. Approximately
three hours prior to arrival, Ivan was observed to have trouble walking. You did not seek veterinary care as
soon as possible for Ivan during transit and Ivan was found unresponsive upon arrival to the destination.

Animal Care believes signs of obvious physical stress were readily observable but a veterinarian was not
contacted to provide direction on adequate and needed care as soon as possible. It is your responsibility to
ensure all applicable standards are being complied with including, but not limited to, determining whether any
live animals are in obvious physical stress and providing any needed veterinary care as soon as possible.

The above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list. Please know that you are responsible for ensuring that your
facility, animals, and property are in compliance with the Animal Welfare regulations.
