*** The greyish rabbit (no ID) was observed breathing with great effort. There are missing hairs and a brownish dry
crusty material around the nose of the rabbit. There is a loose flap of skin over the nose. According to the caretaker
the rabbit was treated with tetracycline for 3 days and has not been treated for the past 3 days. There are no records
to indicate treatment was received. The treatment has not resolved the condition of the rabbit prolonging the animals
suffering. At the time of inspection, the rabbit is showing signs of respiratory distress.

*“* One chinchilla (in top cage with one other chinchilla) is slightly hunched in the corner of the cage, with eyes
partially closed. The chinchilla is also minimally responsive to stimuli. The animal appears to be lethargic and in poor
health. NOTE: The other two chinchillas jumped in response to my presence and touching the cage.

The rabbit and chinchillas must be examined by a veterinarian by March 1, 2016 for an appropriate diagnosis and
treatment plan. The licensee must establish and maintain a program of veterinary care that ensure appropriate
methods to prevent, diagnose, and control disease and illness.

*“*Three chinchillas have coats that appear ruffled and are moderately oily. According to the caretaker, the chinchillas
receive a dust bath once a week. The chinchillas must be examined by a veterinarian to assess the condition of the
chinchilla s coats. To ensure the animals maintain a healthy coat, discuss with the attending veterinarian the
requirements for the frequency of providing a dust bath and husbandry practices. Correct by March 1, 2016

Inspection Report

The attending veterinarian was not contacted regarding the health of the animals.

The licensee failed to adequately observe the animals for illness and failed to promptly contact the attending
veterinarian regarding the health of the rabbit and chinchillas. There must be prompt, direct and frequent contact with
the attending veterinarian on matters of animal health. To ensure the health of the animals, there must be a system in
place that ensures the attending veterinarian is consulted in a timely manner when an animal is observed to be
showing signs of illness. The licensee must establish a system that provides direct and frequent contact with the
attending veterinarian by March 3, 2016.

2.75 (b) (1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.

*““ There is no documentation of the acquisition of 11 rabbits and 3 chinchillas present at the time of inspection.
Gerbils and hamsters were sold since the last inspection, however there is no documentation of the disposition of
these animals. Hamster records do not have the date of acquisition. There are no records of the birth for hamsters
and gerbils. The acquisition and disposition of all animals must be documented to ensure that all animals are
accounted for and receive appropriate care.

The records of acquisition and disposition are incomplete. A dealer must keep and maintain records of animals born,
bought, or acquired by donation; and sold, died, or euthanized. These records must indicate the seller and the date
animals were born, received or bought, or sold, died or euthanized. A system for effectively tracking the acquisitions
and dispositions of animals must be established and maintained. The records must be updated to reflect the current
animal population, including dates, to facilitate the enforcement of the regulations in the Animal Welfare Act. Records
of dispositions and acquisitions must be accurately maintained in accordance with 2.75 (b)(1) to ensure compliance
with the regulations of the Animals Welfare Act.

2.25(a)

REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES.

Air carrier was found to be operating by transporting regulated animals with a cancelled certificate since May 25,
2011. In accordance with the Animal Welfare Act, Part 2, Subpart B, each carrier shall be registered with the
Secretary of the US Department of Agriculture. The air carrier of a cancelled registration is responsible for
re-registering and demonstrating its compliance with the Act and regulations when transporting animals at any time
after its registration is cancelled. The air carrier should complete a properly executed registration form, which was
already furnished by the inspector, and file it with the USDA Animal Care Regional Office as soon as possible.

2.26

ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS.

Forty two (42) puppies younger than six months old were imported from Venezuela without documentation and/or
justification showing animals were intended for research or veterinary treatment. Under USDA rules, you cannot
import a dog younger than 6 months old into the United States for resale or adoption and must have a justification to
import them at that age for research or veterinary treatment. All dogs imported for any of those purposes must have
a valid vaccination against rabies, have certain other vaccinations, a veterinary health certificate and not show signs
of disease on import. The registrant must only import puppies of proper age by following USDA rules/regulations.

3.17(c) CRITICAL

CARE IN TRANSIT.

At the time of inspection, seven (7) puppies of varied breeds (age approximately between two and half to five
months) were found to be in distress and in need of immediate veterinary care. The carrier must determine whether
any of the dogs are in obvious physical distress, and arrange for any needed veterinary care as soon as possible. If
a dog is obviously ill, injured, or in physical distress, the carrier must ensure the animal (s) not be transported in
commerce, except to receive veterinary care for the condition. Before the conclusion of this inspection, the carrier
proactively arranged for immediate veterinary medical care by contracting services with a local veterinary clinic.

At the time of inspection an elderly goat was found to be emaciated and weak. It had difficulty walking, and was
found in a secluded area, on a steep trail. The exhibitor was not aware of the goat's current condition at the time of
inspection, and had not contacted a veterinarian. The goat had been declining for some time, and the exhibitor had
been providing additional feed and care, but the veterinarian had not been specifically consulted regarding the
weight loss.

The exhibitor must ensure that all animals are observed every day, and that any problems or signs of decline are
reported to the attending veterinarian, so that appropriate diagnostics and care can be provided.

This goat must be evaluated by a veterinarian by the end of this day, and daily observation of all animals, with
appropriate follow-up, should be conducted from this time forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.

Date: 17-OCT-2016

2.132(d) CRITICAL

PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.

Section 2.132(d) Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals: The facility purchased two female Hartmann’s
mountain zebra on 6/06/16 from a person who does not hold a valid USDA license. Selling wild/exotic animals to an
exhibitor requires a valid USDA license. Facilities with a valid USDA license are required to comply with the Animal
Welfare Act regulations and standards to ensure the animals receive adequate care, including veterinary care,
husbandry and recordkeeping requirements. This facility was cited under this section in 2013 for leasing a reindeer
for a holiday exhibit from a person who did not have a valid USDA license. No exhibitor shall knowingly obtain any
dog, cat or other animals from any person who is required to be licensed, but who does not hold a valid, and
unsuspended license. Correct by only purchasing wild/exotic animals from people with a valid USDA license.
Correct from this day forward.

3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.

Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: A review of the prairie dog records during this inspection revealed that one
young prairie dog was eaten by a red-tailed hawk on 5/28/16. The prairie dog enclosure is an outdoor enclosure
that is open to the sky/not covered. After the incident no modifications were made to the prairie dog enclosure to
help ensure that red-tailed hawks or other birds of prey could not get into the enclosure to kill more prairie dogs.
Outdoor animal housing facilities must protect the animals from injury, including keeping known predators out of the
animal enclosures. Correct by modifying or changing the prairie dog enclosure to prevent animals from being killed
by birds of prey or other predators and by ensuring that all enclosures protect animals from injury. Correct by
November 18, 2016.

Inspection Report

3.127(c)

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.

Section 3.127(c) Drainage: The water receptacle for the male elk is surrounded by standing water and mud.
Animals should not have to walk through water/mud to get to their water, food or shelter. Standing in water and
mud may cause hoof problems such as foot rot. The drainage must be improved to rapidly eliminate excess water
to prevent muddy conditions and to protect the health of the animal. Once the APHIS official identified the muddy
condition around the water receptacle, facility personnel moved the water receptacle. Corrected during the
inspection.

3.127(d)

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.

Section 3.127(d) Perimeter fence: A beverage service area by and inside the perimeter fence at the edge of the
bison enclosure has a wood bar that is about 37 inches high that is attached to the 8 foot high perimeter fence.

This 8 foot fence is part of the perimeter fence for the entire zoo. The wood bar attached to the perimeter fence
effectively reduces the height of the perimeter fence as it could be used by an animal as a platform to help get over
the additional 5 feet of the perimeter fence. The perimeter fence functions as a secondary containment system for
the animals in the facility and must be at least 8 feet in height for potentially dangerous animals. Correct by moving
the wood bar away from the perimeter fence so it may not be used as a platform for getting over the perimeter fence
by a lose animal. Correct by October 25, 2016.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility 3.

2.40(a)(1) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).

A written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was not available at the time of inspection. The owner stated that he
had not had the veterinarian out this year. There were dead animals within the facility at the time of inspection. A
written program must be available at the facility to assure personnel have accurate instruction for the care of the
animals. Failure to have specific accurate guidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the
current practices at the facility and also does not ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate
veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by developing and implementing a complete, accurate Program of
Veterinary Care. To be corrected by: 20 January 2017

2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).

A litter of weaning age rabbits died prior to the inspection, The owner stated that they had developed diarrhea.
Three other rabbits were found dead during the inspection but The veterinarian had not been contacted. A failure to
conduct adequate observations can result in a delay of care provided to the animals and prolonged animal suffering.
All animals must be observed daily to assess their health and well-being. Problems of animal health, behavior, and
well- being shall be addressed in a timely manner. Direct frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is
necessary to ensure that animals are treated appropriately. Correct by ensuring timely communication of
information to your veterinarian and maintaining documentation of this communication for review by APHIS officials.
Correct from this point forward

SANITATION.

The wire enclosures were generally covered with cobwebs and had accumulations of hair, some also had
accumulations of feces that had not fallen thru the wire floors. Dust and organisms can be collected in these
accumulations and lead to disease in the animals. The areas under the wire floored enclosures contained significant

buildup of feces and liquid which had accumulated to the point that it extended into the isles. The owner stated that
the facility was generally cleaned weekly, on Thursday, but that his help had been sick. Buildup of excreta can
increase the risk of disease in the animals. Waste must be removed and properly disposed of to minimize
infestation, odors and disease. Correct by assuring primary enclosures are kept reasonably free of excreta, hair,
cobwebs and other debris by periodic cleaning and the areas underneath are cleaned at least once each week as
required by section 3.56(a)(3).

3.56(b)

SANITATION.

The enclosures did not appear to have been thoroughly cleaned in the last 30 days. When asked about cleaning,
the owner stated that the enclosures were scrubbed to remove debris and sprayed with bleach solution when the
rabbits were not in them. He indicated the sprayer on the top of the corner shelf which appeared unsanitary and
covered with dust. Failure to adequately sanitize enclosures can lead to disease in the animals. Correct by washing
all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant at least every 30 days. To
be corrected by: 23 January 2017

3.56(c)

SANITATION.

The facility was generally not clean as evidenced by cobwebs, dust and debris throughout. According to the
licensee the cleaning employee had not been at the facility this week. Regular cleaning is needed to facilitate the
husbandry of the animals and prevent the introduction of disease. Accumulations of cage parts, boxes and other
debris were present on top of the cages and throughout the facility. These items appeared to have been in place for
some time. The presence of these items impedes the ability to properly clean and provides harborage for pests.
These factors can lead to disease in the animals. Correct by keeping premises clean and free of accumulations. To
be corrected by: 30 January 2017

3.57 REPEAT

EMPLOYEES.

It was evident from the condition of the facility that not enough employee man hours were being used to clean and
maintain the facility. The owner stated that he had one individual to help but that this individual was currently sick. If
the current number of employees is unable to provide the required man hours to facilitate the care, cleaning and
maintenance then more employees are needed. Failure to provide for sufficient operation of the facility can lead to
disease in the animals. Correct by providing a sufficient number of employees (man-hours) to maintain the
prescribed level of husbandry practices set forth in 9 CFR.

different enclosures/pastures since the last inspection. Heavy rains occurred yesterday and overnight.

*The sheep and goats (total 27 animals) are in the front pasture and have access to a new red four sided shed with
an opening in one side. The owner reports they were all in the shelter during the storm yesterday however
additional shelter should be provided as the shelter size is a very tight fit for all the currently housed sheep and
goats.

not currently have access to a shelter structure and did not overnight. The animals’ haircoats appear wet. The two
alpaca's haircoats appear completely soaked.

*The pigs, cows and zebus all have appropriate shelter.

Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to local climatic conditions for the species concerned must be provided for the

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.

The following information was gathered from an interview with the facility manager. On approximately January 19,
2017 a Lynx was taken out of a temporary holding unit while it's permanent enclosure was to be assessed for
possible repair. The animal was put on a leash by one of the animal caretakers and held in an area where the
public had access. At this time, a member of the public walked directly in front of the animal and it raised up on its
hind legs and wrapped its front paws around her, causing scratches on her where the animal's claws came in
contact. The animal was not under adequate direct control from the trainer, nor was there sufficient distance or
barriers between the animal and the public. Without a proper barrier between the public and dangerous animals,
there is a heightened risk of danger to both the public and the animals, as well as a risk of animal escape.

Correct by: Corrective actions were taken before this focused inspection occurred. Retraining of all employees with
access to animals has occurred and the Lynx in question has since been relocated to another facility.

This was a focused inspection to address allegations brought fourth in a complaint. No animals were inspected at
this time.

This focused inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager.

In the refrigerator where medications are stored for the camels some expired medications were noted including
Cydectin with an expiration date of April 2015. Expired medications may not be effective after the expiration date
resulting in inadequate treatment and preventive care of animals. The attending veterinarian should be contacted to

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).

***A male camel named "Billy" was lying on the ground and unable to return to a standing position. Billy is very thin
and the owner stated the camel is currently under treatment for worms. The owner also stated that the camel is
anemic. The camel was manually assisted by the caretakers to a standing position. The camel may be too weak or
other veterinary care issues may be present preventing the camel from standing without assistance. The attending
veterinarian has not seen these animals recently and this animal needs to be examined immediately to determine a
diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan. The written program of veterinary care needs to address issues of the
older camels. The owner informed the inspector that the camel was deceased during a conversation to discuss
issues concerning the camel's veterinary care.

Date: (PR 2017

2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).

During inspection, two animals were identified as having veterinary care issues. They are as follows:
Direct Veterinary Care Issue:

The first was a tan female Shiba Inu (microchip 1D 9908) nursing five puppies. Two holes were observed
on each side of a nipple on the right side of her body. The larger hole was slightly larger than the size of a quarter.
A reddish colored discharge was observed to be coming from both of the holes. The licensee stated that he had
observed the dog's condition just prior to the start of inspection, but he had not had a chance to document the dog's
condition and had not contacted the Attending Veterinarian or initiated treatment for the dog.

Indirect Veterinary Care Issue:

The second dog was a black and white female Boston Terrier (microchip ID GSE) nursing 8
puppies. The dog was observed to be thin. The dog originally gave birth to 4 puppies, but the licensee later moved
4 puppies from another dog to this dog to give her a total of 8. The licensee stated he had observed the dog to be
thin and had given the dog increased feedings because of that, but had not contacted the Attending Veterinarian to
see if further treatment was necessary or to determine if the 4 puppies that had been placed with this mom should
be moved out of this enclosure.

Untreated medical problems or inadequate follow up with the Attending Veterinarian can cause ongoing pain in
affected animals and can be contagious to other animals in the building. The Attending Veterinarian must be
contacted to properly diagnose and treat each animal's health problem and the facility must follow the
recommended treatment. Documentation of the diagnosis and treatment plan for animals must be available for
APHIS officials for future inspections. Correct by 1/13/17.

Inspection Report

so he could immediately bring the dog to his Attending Veterinarian for treatment.

Note: As of jij 17, treatment has been initiated for tan female Shiba Inu (microchip ID GS .

2.40(b)(3)

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).

A tan female Shiba Inu (microchip |D 999909) ) nursing five puppies was observed to have two holes on each
side of a nipple on the right side of her body. The larger hole was slightly larger than the size of a quarter. A reddish
colored discharge was observed to be coming from both of the holes. The licensee stated that he had observed the
dog's condition just prior to the start of inspection, but he had not had a chance to document the dog's condition and
had not contacted the Attending Veterinarian or initiated treatment for the dog. It appeared that the holes observed
on this dog had not developed recently. This is something that most likely has been developing for days, possibly
even two or three weeks prior to inspection.

Not carefully and thoroughly observing each and every dog every day doesn't ensure that any medical conditions
aren't being missed. Unobserved medical conditions allows for these health problems to go untreated and
potentially get worse and spread to other dogs in the kennel. The facility must develop and maintain a method of
routine daily observations to ensure any animal with a health problem is treated promptly and appropriately. Correct
immediately.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.

Note: This inspection took place over the course of two days: [ji 17 anc jgigil1 7.
