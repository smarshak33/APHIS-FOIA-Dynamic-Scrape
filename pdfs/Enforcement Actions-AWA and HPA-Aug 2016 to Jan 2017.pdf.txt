standards and practices. Sanitization may be done by any of the methods provided in § 3.84(b)(3) of this

animals from extreme weather. The cover was insulated, and enclosed the entire
crate, including the ventilation holes. When you picked up the animals at the
Atlanta airport to deliver them to their final destination, you failed to visually
observe the animals in both crates. At the time of delivery, all 10 piglets in one
of the crates were deceased.

your organization committed violations of the following sections of the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 9:

2.31(d)(1) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC)....repeated failure to
follow the approved procedures involving more than momentary pain and distress and follow the
[ACUC approved protocol and animals to receive appropriate anesthesia or analgesia

On 3/12/14 in Cage ID "Acomys 2", two males had several fight wounds, including "right axillary (very deep, able to
visualize muscle)". The Attending Veterinarian recommended carprofen gel, which is specified in the protocol as
appropriate analgesia. The research group requested no treatment. Five days later there is a notation that the
investigator requested no carprofen gel due to the mouse having a cranial cap. This is despite the fact that the
protocol lists carprofen as a specified appropriate analgesic for this procedure.

On 3/12/14 in Cage ID "Acomys 10” there is a notation that two males have several fight wounds, and one has a leg
wound with intermittent lameness. The Attending Veterinarian recommends carprofen gel for 5 to 7 days for the lame
mouse. There is a request for the research team to approve this treatment within 20 hours. Two days later one mouse
was euthanized, and the other "recovered". No analgesics appear to have been administered.

On 4/16/14 in Cage ID "Acomys 42B" there were two pups noted with "multiple large surface area lesions (superficial
to moderate)". The Attending Veterinarian recommends treatment with Carprofen ge! for two to three days. The next
day the research team replied that they “declined carprofen gel at this time".

In the 5/13/14 IACUC meeting minutes these same researches request a modification to the protocol to "remove anti-
inflammatory agents" for part of the study, in order to "elucidate the differences in inflammatory responses".

On 11/26/13 is observed that at least 6 pigs used in an IACUC protocol experienced unnecessary pain and distress
which may have contributed to their deaths

These examples demonstrate that the research team was not following the IACUC-approved protocol

animals onto their originally-scheduled flight from CLT to ORD, and
subsequently transported them on a later flight to ORD. Due to the missed
flight and weather-related delays, the sugar gliders did not make their
connection to CRW, and the carrier delivered them to you for holding
overnight at ORD. You did not visually observe the sugar gliders or provide
them with food or water. The sugar gliders resumed transit on a flight from
ORD to CRW the following day, and the consignee discovered that they were
dead when she picked them up at CRW. The necropsy performed on the sugar
gliders indicated that they died from probable heat stroke.

committed violations of the following sections of the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 9:

Date: September 13, 2014
§ 3.140(a) — Care in transit.

During surface transportation, it shall be the responsibility of the driver or other employee to visually observe the live
animals as frequently as circumstances may dictate, but not less than once every 4 hours, to assure that they are
receiving sufficient air for normal breathing, their ambient temperatures are within the prescribed limits, all other
applicable standards are being complied with and to determine whether any of the live animals are in obvious physical
distress and to provide any needed veterinary care as soon as possible.

You failed to seek veterinary care as soon as possible for a caracal named Ivan that was in obvious physical
distress during transit. An employee noticed vomit on the floor of the caracal’s enclosure during transit and
observed that Ivan did not appear to be acting normally and was resting his head on the floor. Approximately
three hours prior to arrival, Ivan was observed to have trouble walking. You did not seek veterinary care as
soon as possible for Ivan during transit and Ivan was found unresponsive upon arrival to the destination.

Animal Care believes signs of obvious physical stress were readily observable but a veterinarian was not
contacted to provide direction on adequate and needed care as soon as possible. It is your responsibility to
ensure all applicable standards are being complied with including, but not limited to, determining whether any
live animals are in obvious physical stress and providing any needed veterinary care as soon as possible.

The above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list. Please know that you are responsible for ensuring that your
facility, animals, and property are in compliance with the Animal Welfare regulations.
